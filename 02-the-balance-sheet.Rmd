#The balance sheet

> Nature cannot be fooled --- Richard Feynman

Let’s talk about energy consumption and energy production. At the moment, most
of the energy the developed world consumes is produced from fossil fuels;
that’s not sustainable. Exactly how long we could keep living on fossil fuels
is an interesting question, but it’s not the question we’ll address in this
book. I want to think about *living without fossil fuels*.

We’re going to make two stacks. In the left-hand, red stack we will add up our
energy consumption, and in the right-hand, green stack, we’ll add up
sustainable energy production. We’ll assemble the two stacks gradually, adding
items one at a time as we discuss them.

The question addressed in this book is "can we *conceivably* live sustainably?"
So, we will add up all *conceivable* sustainable energy sources and put them in
the right-hand, green stack.

In the left-hand, red stack, we’ll estimate the consumption of a "typical
moderately-affluent person;" I encourage you to total up an estimate of your
*own* consumption, creating your own personalized left-hand stack too. Later on
we’ll also find out the current *average* energy consumption of Europeans and
Americans.

As we estimate our consumption of energy for heating, transportation,
manufacturing, and so forth, the aim is not only to compute a number for the
left-hand stack of our balance sheet, but also to understand what each number
depends on, and how susceptible to modification it is.

In the right-hand, green stack, we’ll add up the sustainable production
estimates for the United Kingdom. This will allow us to answer the question
"can the UK conceivably live on its own renewables?"

Whether the sustainable energy sources that we put in the right-hand stack are
*economically* feasible is an important question, but let’s leave that question
to one side, and just add up the two stacks first. Sometimes people focus too
much on economic feasibility and they miss the big picture. For example, people
discuss "is wind cheaper than nuclear?" and forget to ask "how *much* wind is
available?" or "how much uranium is left?"

The outcome when we add everything up might look like this:

![](images/figure326.png)

If we find consumption is much less than conceivable sustainable production,
then we can say "good, *maybe* we can live sustainably; let’s look into the
economic, social, and environmental costs of the sustainable alternatives, and
figure out which of them deserve the most research and development; if we do a
good job, there *might* not be an energy crisis."

On the other hand, the outcome of our sums might look like this:

– a much bleaker picture. This picture says "it doesn’t matter what the
economics of sustainable power are: there’s simply *not enough* sustainable
power to support our current lifestyle; massive change is coming."

Energy and power
----------------

Most discussions of energy consumption and production are confusing because of
the proliferation of *units* in which energy and power are measured, from "tons
of oil equivalent" to "terawatt-hours" (TWh) and "exa-joules" (EJ). Nobody but
a specialist has a feeling for what "a barrel of oil" or "a million BTUs" means
in human terms. In this book, we’ll express everything in a single set of
personal units that everyone can relate to.

The unit of **energy** I have chosen is the kilowatt-hour (kWh).  This quantity
is called "one unit" on electricity bills, and it costs a domestic user about
10p in the UK in 2008. As we’ll see, most individual daily choices involve
amounts of energy equal to small numbers of kilowatt-hours.

When we discuss **powers** (rates at which we use or produce energy),the main
unit will be the kilowatt-hour per day (kWh/d). We’ll also occasionally use the
watt (40 W ≈ 1kWh/d) and the kilowatt (1 kW = 1000 W= 24 kWh/d), as I’ll
explain below. The kilowatt-hour per day is a nice human-sized unit: most
personal energy-guzzling activities guzzle at a rate of a small number of
kilowatt-hours per day. For example, one 40 W light-bulb, kept switched on all
the time, uses **one** kilowatt-hour per day.Some electricity companies include
graphs in their electricity bills, showing energy consumption in kilowatt-hours
per day. I’ll use the same unit for all forms of power, not just electricity.
Petrol consumption, gas consumption, coal consumption: I’ll measure all these
powers in kilowatt-hours per day. Let me make this clear: for some people, the
word "power" means only *electrical* energy consumption. But this book concerns
*all* forms of energy consumption and production, and I will use the word
"power" for all of them.

One kilowatt-hour per day is roughly the power you could get from one human
servant. The number of kilowatt-hours per day you use is thus the effective
number of servants you have working for you.

People use the two terms energy and power interchangeably in ordinary speech,
but in this book we must stick rigorously to their scientific definitions.
*Power is the rate at which something uses energy*.

Maybe a good way to explain energy and power is by an analogy with water and
water-flow from taps. If you want a drink of water, you want a *volume* of
water – one litre, perhaps (if you’re thirsty). When you turn on a tap, you
create a *flow* of water – one litre per minute, say, if the tap yields only a
trickle; or 10 litres per minute, from a more generous tap. You can get the
same volume (one litre) either by running the trickling tap for one minute, or
by running the generous tap for one tenth of a minute. The *volume* delivered
in a particular time is equal to the *flow* multiplied by the

![](images/figure18.png)

Figure 2.1. Distinguishing energy and power. Each of these 60W light bulbs has
a power of 60W when switched-on; it doesn’t have an "energy" of 60W. The bulb
uses 60W of electrical power when it’s on; it emits 60W of power in the form of
light and heat(mainly the latter).

Volume is measured in litres

Flow is measured in litres per minute

Energy is measured in kWh

Power is measured in kWh per day

*time:*

$volume = flow \times time.$

We say that a *flow* is a *rate* at which *volume* is delivered. If you
know thevolume delivered in a particular time, you get the flow by
dividing the volume by the time:

$flow = \frac{volume}{time}$

Here’s the connection to energy and power. *Energy* is like water
*volume*:*power* is like water *flow*. For example, whenever a toaster is
switched on, itstarts to consume *power* at a rate of one kilowatt. It
continues to consumeone kilowatt until it is switched off. To put it
another way, the toaster (ifit’s left on permanently) consumes one
kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy per hour; it also consumes 24
kilowatt-hours per day.

The longer the toaster is on, the more energy it uses. You can work
out the energy used by a particular activity by multiplying the power by
the duration:

energy= power × time.

The joule is the standard international unit of energy, but sadly it’s
far too small to work with. The kilowatt-hour is equal to 3.6 million
joules (3.6mega joules).

Powers are so useful and important, they have something that water flows don’t
have: they have their own special units. When we talk of a flow, we might
measure it in "litres per minute," "gallons per hour," or"cubic-metres per
second;" these units’ names make clear that the flow is"a volume per unit
time." A power of *one joule per second* is called *one watt*.1000 joules per
second is called one kilowatt. Let’s get the terminology straight: the toaster
uses one kilowatt. It doesn’t use "one kilowatt per second." The "per second"
is already built in to the definition of the kilowatt^[Other examples of units
that, like the watt, already have a "per time" built in are the knot – "our
yacht’s speed was ten knots!" (a knot is one nautical mile *per* hour); the
hertz – "I could hear a buzzing at 50 hertz" (one hertz is a frequency of one
cycle *per* second); the ampere – "the fuse blows when the current is higher
than 13 amps" (*not* 13 amps per second); and the horsepower – "that stinking
engine delivers 50 horsepower" (*not* 50 horsepower per second, nor 50
horsepower per hour, nor 50 horsepower per day, just 50 horsepower).]: one
kilowatt means "one kilo-joule per second." Similarly we say "a nuclear power
station generates one gigawatt." One gigawatt, by the way, is one billion
watts, one million kilowatts, or 1000 megawatts. So one gigawatt is a million
toasters. And the "g" s in gigawatt are pronounced hard, the same as in
"giggle." And, while I’m tapping the blackboard, we capitalize the "g" and "w"
in "gigawatt" only when we write the abbreviation "GW."

Please, never, ever say "one kilowatt per second,"^[There are specific, rare
exceptions to this rule. If talking about a growth in demand for power, we
might say "British demand is growing at one gigawatt per year." In Chapter 26
when I discuss fluctuations in wind power, I will say "one morning, the power
delivered by Irish windmills fell at a rate of84 MW per hour." Please take
care! Just one accidental syllable can lead to confusion: for example, your
electricity meter’s reading is in kilowatt-hours (kWh), *not*
‘kilowatts-per-hour’.] "one kilowatt per hour," or "one kilowatt per day;" none
of these is a valid measure of power.The urge that people have to say "per
something" when talking about their toasters is one of the reasons I decided to
use the "kilowatt-hour per day" as my unit of power. I’m sorry that it’s a bit
cumbersome to say and to write.

Here’s one last thing to make clear: if I say "someone used a
gigawatt-hour of energy," I am simply telling you *how much* energy they
used, not*how fast* they used it. Talking about a gigawatt-hour
*doesn’t* imply the energy was used *in one hour*. You could use a gigawatt-hour of energy
byswitching on one million toasters for one hour, or by switching on
1000toasters for 1000 hours.

energy is measured in kWh or MJ

power is measured in kWh per day or kW or W (watts) or MW (megawatts) or GW
(gigawatts) or TW (terawatts)

As I said, I’ll usually quote powers in kWh/d *per person*. One
reason for liking these personal units is that it makes it much easier to
move from talking about the UK to talking about other countries or
regions. For ex-ample, imagine we are discussing waste incineration and
we learn that UK waste incineration delivers a power of 7 TWh per year
and that Den-mark’s waste incineration delivers 10 TWh per year. Does
this help us say whether Denmark incinerates "more" waste than the UK?
While the total power produced from waste in each country may be
interesting, I think that what we usually want to know is the waste
incineration *per person*.(For the record, that is: Denmark, 5 kWh/d per
person; UK, 0.3 kWh/d per person. So Danes incinerate about 13 times as
much waste as Brits.) To save ink, I’ll sometimes abbreviate "per person"
to "/p" . By discussing everything per-person from the outset, we end up
with a more transportable book, one that will hopefully be useful for
sustainable energy discussions worldwide.

Picky details
-------------

#### Isn’t energy conserved? We talk about "using" energy, but doesn’t one ofthe laws of nature say that energy can’t be created or destroyed?

Yes, I’m being imprecise. This is really a book about *entropy* – a
trickier thing to explain. When we "use up" one kilojoule of energy, what
we’re really doing is taking one kilojoule of energy in a form that has
*low entropy*(for example, electricity), and *converting* it into an
exactly equal amount of energy in another form, usually one that has much
higher entropy (for example, hot air or hot water). When we’ve "used" the
energy, it’s still there; but we normally can’t "use" the energy over and
over again, because only *low entropy* energy is "useful" to us.
Sometimes these different grades of energy are distinguished by adding a
label to the units: one kWh(e) is one kilowatt-hour of electrical energy
– the highest grade of energy. One kWh(th) is one kilowatt-hour of
thermal energy – for example the energy in ten litres of boiling-hot
water. Energy lurking in higher-temperature things is more useful (lower
entropy) than energy in tepid things. A third grade of energy is chemical
energy. Chemical energy is high-grade energy like electricity.

It’s a convenient but sloppy shorthand to talk about the energy
rather than the entropy, and that is what we’ll do most of the time in
this book. Occasionally, we’ll have to smarten up this sloppiness; for
example, when we discuss refrigeration, power stations, heat pumps, or
geothermal power.

1TWh (one terawatt-hour) is equal to one billion kWh.

#### Are you comparing apples and oranges? Is it valid to compare different forms of energy such as the chemical energy that is fed into a petrol-powered car and the electricity from a wind turbine?

By comparing consumed energy with conceivable produced energy, I do not
wish to imply that all forms of energy are equivalent and
interchange-able. The electrical energy produced by a wind turbine is of
no use to a petrol engine; and petrol is no use if you want to power a
television.In principle, energy can be converted from one form to
another, though conversion entails losses. Fossil-fuel power stations,
for example, guzzle *chemical energy* and produce *electricity* (with an
efficiency of 40% or so).And aluminium plants guzzle *electrical energy*
to create a product with high *chemical energy* – aluminium (with an
efficiency of 30% or so).

In some summaries of energy production and consumption, all the
different forms of energy are put into the same units, but multipliers
are introduced, rating electrical energy from hydroelectricity for
example as being worth 2.5 times more than the chemical energy in oil.
This bumping up of electricity’s effective energy value can be justified
by saying, "well, 1 kWh of electricity is equivalent to 2.5 kWh of oil,
because if we put that much oil into a standard power station it would
deliver 40% of 2.5 kWh,which is 1 kWh of electricity." In this book,
however, I will usually use a one-to-one conversion rate when comparing
different forms of energy. It is *not* the case that 2.5 kWh of oil is
inescapably equivalent to 1 kWh of electricity; that just happens to be
the perceived exchange rate in a world-view where oil is used to make
electricity. Yes, conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy is
done with this particular inefficient exchange rate. But electrical energy
can also be converted to chemical energy. In an alternative world
(perhaps not far-off) with relatively plentiful electricity and little
oil, we might use electricity to make liquid fuels; in that world we
would surely not use the same exchange rate – each kWh of gasoline would
then cost us something like 3 kWh of electricity! I think the
timeless and scientific way to summarize and compare energies is to hold 1
kWh of chemical energy equivalent to 1 kWh of electricity. My choice to
use this one-to-one conversion rate means that some of my sums will look
a bit different from other people’s. (For example, BP’s *Statistical
Review of World Energy* rates 1 kWh of electricity as equivalent to
$\frac{100}{38} \approx 2.6 kWh$ of oil; on the other hand, the government’s *Digest of
UK Energy Statistics*uses the same one-to-one conversion rate as me.)
And I emphasize again,this choice does not imply that I’m suggesting you
could convert either form of energy directly into the other. Converting
chemical energy into electrical energy always wastes energy, and so does
converting electrical into chemical energy.

Physics and equations
---------------------

Throughout the book, my aim is not only to work out numbers
indicating our current energy consumption and conceivable sustainable
production, but also to make clear *what these numbers depend on*. Understanding
what the numbers depend on is essential if we are to choose sensible
policies to change any of the numbers. Only if we understand the physics
behind energy consumption and energy production can we assess assertions
such as "cars waste 99% of the energy they consume; we could redesign
cars so that they use 100 times less energy." Is this assertion true? To
explain the answer, I will need to use equations like

![ ](images/figure10.png)

However, I recognize that to many readers, such formulae are a foreign
language. So, here’s my promise: *I’ll keep all this foreign-language
stuff in technical chapters at the end of the book*. Any reader with
a high-school/secondary-school qualification in maths, physics, or
chemistry should enjoy these technical chapters. The main thread of the
book (from page 2 to page 250)is intended to be accessible to everyone
who can add, multiply, and divide.It is especially aimed at our dear
elected and unelected representatives, the Members of Parliament.

One last point, before we get rolling: I don’t know everything
about energy. I don’t have all the answers, and the numbers I offer are
open to revision and correction. (Indeed I expect corrections and will
publish them on the book’s website.) The one thing I *am* sure of is that
the answers to our sustainable energy questions will involve *numbers* ;
any sane discussion of sustainable energy requires numbers. This book’s
got ’em, and it shows how to handle them. I hope you enjoy it!
