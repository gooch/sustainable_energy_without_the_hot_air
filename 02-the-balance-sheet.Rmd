 The balance sheet

> Nature cannot be fooled --- Richard Feynman

Let’s talk about energy consumption and energy production. At the moment, most
of the energy the developed world consumes is produced from fossil fuels;
that’s not sustainable. Exactly how long we could keep living on fossil fuels
is an interesting question, but it’s not the question we’ll address in this
book. I want to think about *living without fossil fuels*.

We’re going to make two stacks. In the left-hand, red stack we will add up our
energy consumption, and in the right-hand, green stack, we’ll add up
sustainable energy production. We’ll assemble the two stacks gradually, adding
items one at a time as we discuss them.

The question addressed in this book is "can we *conceivably* live sustainably?"
So, we will add up all *conceivable* sustainable energy sources and put them in
the right-hand, green stack.

In the left-hand, red stack, we’ll estimate the consumption of a "typical
moderately-affluent person;" I encourage you to total up an estimate of your
*own* consumption, creating your own personalized left-hand stack too. Later on
we’ll also find out the current *average* energy consumption of Europeans and
Americans.

As we estimate our consumption of energy for heating, transportation,
manufacturing, and so forth, the aim is not only to compute a number for the
left-hand stack of our balance sheet, but also to understand what each number
depends on, and how susceptible to modification it is.

In the right-hand, green stack, we’ll add up the sustainable production
estimates for the United Kingdom. This will allow us to answer the question
"can the UK conceivably live on its own renewables?"

Whether the sustainable energy sources that we put in the right-hand stack are
*economically* feasible is an important question, but let’s leave that question
to one side, and just add up the two stacks first. Sometimes people focus too
much on economic feasibility and they miss the big picture. For example, people
discuss "is wind cheaper than nuclear?" and forget to ask "how *much* wind is
available?" or "how much uranium is left?"

The outcome when we add everything up might look like this:

![](figure326.png)

If we find consumption is much less than conceivable sustainable production,
then we can say "good, *maybe* we can live sustainably; let’s look into the
economic, social, and environmental costs of the sustainable alternatives, and
figure out which of them deserve the most research and development; if we do a
good job, there *might* not be an energy crisis."

On the other hand, the outcome of our sums might look like this:

![](figure327.png)

– a much bleaker picture. This picture says "it doesn’t matter what the
economics of sustainable power are: there’s simply *not enough* sustainable
power to support our current lifestyle; massive change is coming."

Energy and power
----------------

Most discussions of energy consumption and production are confusing because of
the proliferation of *units* in which energy and power are measured, from "tons
of oil equivalent" to "terawatt-hours" (TWh) and "exa-joules" (EJ). Nobody but
a specialist has a feeling for what "a barrel of oil" or "a million BTUs" means
in human terms. In this book, we’ll express everything in a single set of
personal units that everyone can relate to.

The unit of **energy** I have chosen is the kilowatt-hour (kWh).  This quantity
is called "one unit" on electricity bills, and it costs a domestic user about
10p in the UK in 2008. As we’ll see, most individual daily choices involve
amounts of energy equal to small numbers of kilowatt-hours.

When we discuss **powers** (rates at which we use or produce energy),the main
unit will be the kilowatt-hour per day (kWh/d). We’ll also occasionally use the
watt (40 W ≈ 1kWh/d) and the kilowatt (1 kW = 1000 W= 24 kWh/d), as I’ll
explain below. The kilowatt-hour per day is a nice human-sized unit: most
personal energy-guzzling activities guzzle at a rate of a small number of
kilowatt-hours per day. For example, one 40 W light-bulb, kept switched on all
the time, uses **one** kilowatt-hour per day.Some electricity companies include
graphs in their electricity bills, showing energy consumption in kilowatt-hours
per day. I’ll use the same unit for all forms of power, not just electricity.
Petrol consumption, gas consumption, coal consumption: I’ll measure all these
powers in kilowatt-hours per day. Let me make this clear: for some people, the
word "power" means only *electrical* energy consumption. But this book concerns
*all* forms of energy consumption and production, and I will use the word
"power" for all of them.

One kilowatt-hour per day is roughly the power you could get from one
human servant. The number of kilowatt-hours per day you use is thus the
effective number of servants you have working for you.

People use the two terms energy and power interchangeably in ordinary
speech, but in this book we must stick rigorously to their
scientificdefinitions. *Power is the rate at which something uses energy*.

Maybe a good way to explain energy and power is by an analogy withwater
and water-flow from taps. If you want a drink of water, you want
a*volume* of water – one litre, perhaps (if you’re thirsty). When you
turn on atap, you create a *flow* of water – one litre per minute, say,
if the tap yieldsonly a trickle; or 10 litres per minute, from a more
generous tap. You canget the same volume (one litre) either by running
the trickling tap for oneminute, or by running the generous tap for one
tenth of a minute. The*volume* delivered in a particular time is equal
to the *flow* multiplied by the

![](figure18.png)

Figure 2.1. Distinguishing energy andpower. Each of these 60W light
bulbshas a power of 60W when switchedon; it doesn’t have an "energy"
of60W. The bulb uses 60W of electricalpower when it’s on; it emits 60 W
ofpower in the form of light and heat(mainly the latter).

volumeis measured inlitres

flowis measured inlitres per minute

energyis measured inkWh

poweris measured inkWh per day

*time:*

volume = flow × time.

We say that a *flow* is a *rate* at which *volume* is delivered. If you
know thevolume delivered in a particular time, you get the flow by
dividing thevolume by the time:

![](figure7.png)

Here’s the connection to energy and power. *Energy* is like water
*volume*:*power* is like water *flow*. For example, whenever a toaster is
switched on, itstarts to consume *power* at a rate of one kilowatt. It
continues to consumeone kilowatt until it is switched off. To put it
another way, the toaster (ifit’s left on permanently) consumes one
kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy perhour; it also consumes 24
kilowatt-hours per day.

The longer the toaster is on, the more energy it uses. You can work
outthe energy used by a particular activity by multiplying the power by
theduration:

energy= power × time.

The joule is the standard international unit of energy, but sadly it’s
fartoo small to work with. The kilowatt-hour is equal to 3.6 million
joules (3.6megajoules).

Powers are so useful and important, they have something that waterflows
don’t have: they have their own special units. When we talk of aflow, we
might measure it in "litres per minute," "gallons per hour,"
or"cubic-metres per second;" these units’ names make clear that the flow
is"a volume per unit time." A power of *one joule per second* is called
*one watt*.1000 joules per second is called one kilowatt. Let’s get the
terminologystraight: the toaster uses one kilowatt. It doesn’t use "one
kilowatt per sec-ond." The "per second" is already built in to the
definition of the kilowatt:one kilowatt means "one kilojoule per second."
Similarly we say "a nuclearpower station generates one gigawatt." One
gigawatt, by the way, is onebillion watts, one million kilowatts, or
1000 megawatts. So one gigawattis a million toasters. And the "g" s in
gigawatt are pronounced hard, thesame as in "giggle." And, while I’m
tapping the blackboard, we capital-ize the "g" and "w" in "gigawatt"
only when we write the abbreviation"GW."

Please, never, ever say "one kilowatt per second," "one kilowatt
perhour," or "one kilowatt per day;" none of these is a valid measure of
power.The urge that people have to say "per something" when talking
about theirtoasters is one of the reasons I decided to use the
"kilowatt-hour per day" as my unit of power. I’m sorry that it’s a bit
cumbersome to say and towrite.

Here’s one last thing to make clear: if I say "someone used a
gigawatt-hour of energy," I am simply telling you*how much* energy they
used, not*how fast* they used it. Talking about a gigawatt-hour
*doesn’t* imply the

energyis measured inkWhorMJ

poweris measured inkWh per dayorkWorW (watts)orMW (megawatts)orGW
(gigawatts)orTW (terawatts)

energy was used *in one hour*. You could use a gigawatt-hour of energy
byswitching on one million toasters for one hour, or by switching on
1000toasters for 1000 hours.

As I said, I’ll usually quote powers in kWh/d *per person*. One
reasonfor liking these personal units is that it makes it much easier to
move fromtalking about the UK to talking about other countries or
regions. For ex-ample, imagine we are discussing waste incineration and
we learn thatUK waste incineration delivers a power of 7 TWh per year
and that Den-mark’s waste incineration delivers 10 TWh per year. Does
this help us saywhether Denmark incinerates "more" waste than the UK?
While the totalpower produced from waste in each country may be
interesting, I thinkthat what we usually want to know is the waste
incineration *per person*.(For the record, that is: Denmark, 5 kWh/d per
person; UK, 0.3 kWh/dper person. So Danes incinerate about 13 times as
much waste as Brits.) Tosave ink, I’ll sometimes abbreviate "per person"
to "/p" . By discussing ev-erything per-person from the outset, we end up
with a more transportablebook, one that will hopefully be useful for
sustainable energy discussionsworldwide.

Picky details
-------------

#### Isn’t energy conserved? We talk about "using" energy, but doesn’t one ofthe laws of nature say that energy can’t be created or destroyed?

Yes, I’m being imprecise. This is really a book about *entropy* – a
trickierthing to explain. When we "use up" one kilojoule of energy, what
we’rereally doing is taking one kilojoule of energy in a form that has
*low entropy*(for example, electricity), and *converting* it into an
exactly equal amountof energy in another form, usually one that has much
higher entropy (forexample, hot air or hot water). When we’ve "used" the
energy, it’s stillthere; but we normally can’t "use" the energy over and
over again, becauseonly *low entropy* energy is "useful" to us.
Sometimes these different gradesof energy are distinguished by adding a
label to the units: one kWh(e) isone kilowatt-hour of electrical energy
– the highest grade of energy. OnekWh(th) is one kilowatt-hour of
thermal energy – for example the energyin ten litres of boiling-hot
water. Energy lurking in higher-temperaturethings is more useful (lower
entropy) than energy in tepid things. A thirdgrade of energy is chemical
energy. Chemical energy is high-grade energylike electricity.

It’s a convenient but sloppy shorthand to talk about the energy
ratherthan the entropy, and that is what we’ll do most of the time in
this book.Occasionally, we’ll have to smarten up this sloppiness; for
example, whenwe discuss refrigeration, power stations, heat pumps, or
geothermal power.

#### Are you comparing apples and oranges? Is it valid to compare different

1TWh (one terawatt-hour) is equal toone billion kWh.

#### forms of energy such as the chemical energy that is fed into a petrol-powered car and the electricity from a wind turbine?

By comparing consumed energy with conceivable produced energy, I donot
wish to imply that all forms of energy are equivalent and
interchange-able. The electrical energy produced by a wind turbine is of
no use toa petrol engine; and petrol is no use if you want to power a
television.In principle, energy can be converted from one form to
another, thoughconversion entails losses. Fossil-fuel power stations,
for example, guzzle*chemical energy* and produce *electricity* (with an
efficiency of 40% or so).And aluminium plants guzzle *electrical energy*
to create a product withhigh *chemical energy* – aluminium (with an
efficiency of 30% or so).

In some summaries of energy production and consumption, all the
dif-ferent forms of energy are put into the same units, but multipliers
areintroduced, rating electrical energy from hydroelectricity for
example asbeing worth 2.5 times more than the chemical energy in oil.
This bumpingup of electricity’s effective energy value can be justified
by saying, "well,1 kWh of electricity is equivalent to 2.5 kWh of oil,
because if we put thatmuch oil into a standard power station it would
deliver 40% of 2.5 kWh,which is 1 kWh of electricity." In this book,
however, I will usually use aone-to-one conversion rate when comparing
different forms of energy. Itis *not* the case that 2.5 kWh of oil is
inescapably equivalent to 1 kWh ofelectricity; that just happens to be
the perceived exchange rate in a world-view where oil is used to make
electricity. Yes, conversion of chemicalenergy to electrical energy is
done with this particular inefficient exchangerate. But electrical energy
can also be converted to chemical energy. In analternative world
(perhaps not far-off) with relatively plentiful electricityand little
oil, we might use electricity to make liquid fuels; in that worldwe
would surely not use the same exchange rate – each kWh of gasolinewould
then cost us something like 3 kWh of electricity! I think the
timelessand scientific way to summarize and compare energies is to hold 1
kWhof chemical energy equivalent to 1 kWh of electricity. My choice to
usethis one-to-one conversion rate means that some of my sums will look
abit different from other people’s. (For example, BP’s *Statistical
Review ofWorld Energy* rates 1 kWh of electricity as equivalent to
100/38 ≈ 2.6 kWhof oil; on the other hand, the government’s *Digest of
UK Energy Statistics*uses the same one-to-one conversion rate as me.)
And I emphasize again,this choice does not imply that I’m suggesting you
could convert eitherform of energy directly into the other. Converting
chemical energy intoelectrical energy always wastes energy, and so does
converting electricalinto chemical energy.

Physics and equations
---------------------

Throughout the book, my aim is not only to work out numbers
indicatingour current energy consumption and conceivable sustainable
production,

but also to make clear *what these numbers depend on*. Understanding
whatthe numbers depend on is essential if we are to choose sensible
policiesto change any of the numbers. Only if we understand the physics
behindenergy consumption and energy production can we assess assertions
suchas "cars waste 99% of the energy they consume; we could redesign
cars sothat they use 100 times less energy." Is this assertion true? To
explain theanswer, I will need to use equations like

![ ](figure10.png)

However, I recognize that to many readers, such formulae are a foreign
lan-guage. So, here’s my promise: *I’ll keep all this foreign-language
stuff in techni-**cal chapters at the end of the book*. Any reader with
a high-school/secondary-school qualification in maths, physics, or
chemistry should enjoy thesetechnical chapters. The main thread of the
book (from page 2 to page 250)is intended to be accessible to everyone
who can add, multiply, and divide.It is especially aimed at our dear
elected and unelected representatives, theMembers of Parliament.

One last point, before we get rolling: I don’t know everything
aboutenergy. I don’t have all the answers, and the numbers I offer are
open torevision and correction. (Indeed I expect corrections and will
publish themon the book’s website.) The one thing I *am* sure of is that
the answers toour sustainable energy questions will involve *numbers* ;
any sane discussionof sustainable energy requires numbers. This book’s
got ’em, and it showshow to handle them. I hope you enjoy it!

Notes and further reading
-------------------------

page no.

25*The "per second" is already built in to the definition of the
kilowatt.* Other examples of units that, like the watt, alreadyhave a
"per time" built in are the knot – "our yacht’s speed was ten knots!" (a
knot is one nautical mile *per* hour); thehertz – "I could hear a
buzzing at 50 hertz" (one hertz is a frequency of one cycle *per*
second); the ampere – "the fuseblows when the current is higher than 13
amps" (*not* 13 amps per second); and the horsepower – "that stinking
enginedelivers 50 horsepower" (*not* 50 horsepower per second, nor 50
horsepower per hour, nor 50 horsepower per day, just50 horsepower).

–*Please, never, ever say "one kilowatt per second." * There are specific,
rare exceptions to this rule. If talking about agrowth in demand for
power, we might say "British demand is growing at one gigawatt per
year." In Chapter 26 whenI discuss fluctuations in wind power, I will say
"one morning, the power delivered by Irish windmills fell at a rate of84
MW per hour." Please take care! Just one accidental syllable can lead to
confusion: for example, your electricitymeter’s reading is in
kilowatt-hours (kWh), *not* ‘kilowatts-per-hour’.

I’ve provided a chart on p368 to help you translate between kWh per day
per person and the other major units in whichpowers are discussed.
