# Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air, David JC MacKay

This is a project to migrate the book Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air, by David JC MacKay to bookdown.

I envisage that there's three phases to the migration.

1. Convert HTML to markdown --- mostly done [Tito Jankowski], but needs manually cleaning.
2. Remove copyrighted images.
3. Move the footnotes in the further reading sections into footnotes in-stream.
4. Create figures and cross reference them using bookdown cross-referencing syntax.
5. Replace graphs png files with native ggplot graphs, tracking down data sources may take some time.
