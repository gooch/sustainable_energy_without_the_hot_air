# Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air, David JC MacKay

This is a project to migrate the book Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air, by David JC MacKay to bookdown.

I envisage that there's three phases to the migration.

1. Convert HTML to markdown --- mostly done [Tito Jankowski], but needs manually cleaning.
2. Move the footnotes in the further reading sections into footnotes in-stream.
3. Create figures and cross reference them using bookdown cross-referencing syntax.
4. Replace graphs png files with native ggplot graphs, tracking down data sources may take some time.
