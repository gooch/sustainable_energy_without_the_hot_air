> We live at a time when emotions and feelings count more than truth,
> and there is a vast ignorance of science.James Lovelock

I recently read two books, one by a physicist, and one by an economist.In *Out
of Gas*, Caltech physicist David Goodstein describes an impending energy crisis
brought on by The End of the Age of Oil. This crisis is coming soon, he
predicts: the crisis will bite, not when the last drop of oil is extracted, but
when oil extraction can’t meet demand – perhaps as soon as 2015 or 2025.
Moreover, even if we magically switched all our energy-guzzling to nuclear
power right away, Goodstein says, the oil crisis would simply be replaced by a
*nuclear* crisis in just twenty years or so, as uranium reserves also became
depleted.

In *The Skeptical Environmentalist*, Bjørn Lomborg paints a completely
different picture. “Everything is fine.” Indeed, “everything is getting
better.” Furthermore, “we are not headed for a major energy crisis,” and“there
is plenty of energy.”

How could two smart people come to such different conclusions? I had to get to
the bottom of this.

Energy made it into the British news in 2006. Kindled by tidings of great
climate change and a tripling in the price of natural gas in just six years,
the flames of debate are raging. How should Britain handle its energy needs?
And how should the world?

“Wind or nuclear?”, for example. Greater polarization of views among smart
people is hard to imagine. During a discussion of the proposed expansion of
nuclear power, Michael Meacher, former environment minister,said “if we’re
going to cut greenhouse gases by 60% ... by 2050 there is no other possible way
of doing that except through renewables;” Sir Bernard Ingham, former civil
servant, speaking in favour of nuclear expansion, said“ anybody who is relying
upon renewables to fill the [energy] gap is living in an utter dream world and
is, in my view, an enemy of the people.”

Similar disagreement can be heard within the ecological movement.All agree that
*something* must be done urgently, but *what?* Jonathon Porritt, chair of the
Sustainable Development Commission, writes: “there is no justification for
bringing forward plans for a new nuclear power pro-gramme at this time, and ...
any such proposal would be incompatible with [the Government’s] sustainable
development strategy;” and “a non-nuclear strategy could and should be
sufficient to deliver all the carbon savings we shall need up to 2050 and
beyond, and to ensure secure access to reliable sources of energy.” In
contrast, environmentalist James Lovelock writes in his book, *The Revenge of
Gaia*: “Now is much too late to establish sustainable development.” In his
view, power from nuclear fission, while not recommended as the long-term
panacea for our ailing planet, is “the only effective medicine we have now.”
Onshore wind turbines are “merely ... a gesture to prove [our leaders’]
environmental credentials.”

This heated debate is fundamentally about numbers. How much energy could each
source deliver, at what economic and social cost, and with what risks? But
actual numbers are rarely mentioned. In public debates,people just say “Nuclear
is a money pit” or “We have a *huge* amount of wave and wind.” The trouble with
this sort of language is that it’s not sufficient to know that something is
huge: we need to know how the one “huge” compares with another “huge,” namely
*our huge energy consumption*. To make this comparison, we need numbers, not
adjectives.

Where numbers are used, their meaning is often obfuscated by enormousness.
Numbers are chosen to impress, to score points in arguments,rather than to
inform. “Los Angeles residents drive 142 million miles – the distance from
Earth to Mars – every single day.” “Each year, 27 million acres of tropical
rainforest are destroyed.” “14 billion pounds of trash are dumped into the sea
every year.” “British people throw away 2.6 billion slices of bread per year.”
“The waste paper buried each year in the UK could fill 103448 double-decker
buses.”

If all the ineffective ideas for solving the energy crisis were laid end to
end, they would reach to the moon and back... I digress.

The result of this lack of meaningful numbers and facts? We are inundated with
a flood of crazy innumerate codswallop. The BBC doles out advice on how we can
do our bit to save the planet – for example “switch off your mobile phone
charger when it’s not in use;” if anyone objects that mobile phone chargers are
not *actually* our number one form of energy consumption, the mantra “every
little helps”^[For the benefit of readers who speak American, rather than
English, the translation of “every little helps” into American is “every little
bit helps.”] is wheeled out.  Every little helps? A more realistic mantra is:

> if everyone does a little, we’ll achieve only a little.

Companies also contribute to the daily codswallop as they tell us how wonderful
they are, or how they can help us “do our bit.” BP’s website, for example,
celebrates the reductions in carbon dioxide (CO~2~) pollution they hope to
achieve by changing the paint used for painting BP’s ships. Does anyone fall
for this? Surely everyone will guess that it’s not the exterior paint job, it’s
the stuff *inside* the tanker that deserves attention, if society’s CO~2~
emissions are to be significantly cut? BP also created a web-based carbon
absolution service, “targetneutral.com,” which claims that they can“neutralize”
all your carbon emissions, and that it “doesn’t cost the earth”– indeed, that
your CO~2~ pollution can be cleaned up for just £40 per year. How can this add
up? – if the true cost of fixing climate change were £40per person then the
government could fix it with the loose change in the Chancellor’s pocket!

Even more reprehensible are companies that exploit the current
concern for the environment by offering “water-powered batteries,”
“biodegradable mobile phones,” “portable arm-mounted wind-turbines,” and
other pointless tat.

Campaigners also mislead. People who want to promote renewables over nuclear,
for example, say “offshore wind power could power all UK homes;” then they say
“new nuclear power stations will do little to tackle climate change” because 10
new nuclear stations would “reduce emissions only by about 4%.” This argument
is misleading because the playing field is switched half-way through, from the
“number of homes powered” to “reduction of emissions.” The truth is that the
amount of electrical power generated by the wonderful windmills that “could
power all UK homes” is *exactly the same* as the amount that would be generated
by the 10 nuclear power stations! “Powering all UK homes” accounts for just 4%
of UK emissions.

Perhaps the worst offenders in the kingdom of codswallop are the people who
really should know better – the media publishers who promote the codswallop –
for example, New Scientist with their article about the “water-powered
car.”^[See this chapter’s notes (p19) for the awful details. (Every chapter has
endnotes giving references, sources, and details of arguments.]

In a climate where people don’t understand the numbers, newspapers,
campaigners, companies, and politicians can get away with murder.

We need simple numbers, and we need the numbers to be comprehensible,
comparable, and memorable.

With numbers in place, we will be better placed to answer questions such
as these:

1.  Can a country like Britain conceivably live on its own renewable energy
    sources?
2.  If everyone turns their thermostats one degree closer to the outside
    temperature, drives a smaller car, and switches off phone chargers when not
    in use, will an energy crisis be averted?
3.  Should the tax on transportation fuels be significantly increased? Should
    speed-limits on roads be halved?
4.  Is someone who advocates windmills over nuclear power stations “an enemy of
    the people”?
5.  If climate change is “a greater threat than terrorism,” should governments
    criminalize “the glorification of travel” and pass laws against “advocating
    acts of consumption”?
6.  Will a switch to “advanced technologies” allow us to eliminate carbon
    dioxide pollution without changing our lifestyle?
7.  Should people be encouraged to eat more vegetarian food?
8.  Is the population of the earth six times too big?
