#Tide

The moon and earth are in a whirling, pirouetting dance around the sun.
Together they tour the sun once every year, at the same time whirling
around each other once every 28 days. The moon also turns around once
every 28 days so that she always shows the same face to her dancing
part- ner, the earth. The prima donna earth doesn't return the
compliment; she pirouettes once every day. This dance is held together
by the force of grav- ity: every bit of the earth, moon, and sun is
pulled towards every other bit of earth, moon, and sun. The sum of all
these forces is *almost* exactly what's required to keep the whirling
dance on course. But there are very slight imbalances between the
gravitational forces and the forces required to maintain the dance. It
is these imbalances that give rise to the tides.

The imbalances associated with the whirling of the moon and earth around
each other are about three times as big as the imbalances associated
with the earth's slower dance around the sun, so the size of the tides
varies with the phase of the moon, as the moon and sun pass in and out
of alignment. At full moon and new moon (when the moon and sun are in
line with each other) the imbalances reinforce each other, and the
resulting big tides are called *spring tides*. (Spring tides are *not*
"tides that occur at spring-time;" spring tides happen every two weeks
like clockwork.) At the intervening half moons, the imbalances partly
cancel and the tides are smaller; these smaller tides are called *neap
tides*. Spring tides have roughly twice the amplitude of neap tides: the
spring high tides are twice as high above mean sea level as neap high
tides, the spring low tides are twice as low as neap low tides, and the
tidal currents are twice as big at springs as at neaps.

Why are there two high tides and two low tides per day? Well, if the
earth were a perfect sphere, a smooth billiard ball covered by oceans,
the tidal effect of the earth-moon whirling would be to deform the wa-
ter slightly towards and away from the moon, making the water slightly
rugby-ball shaped (images/figure 14.1). Someone living on the equator of this
billiard-ball earth, spinning round once per day within the water
cocoon, would notice the water level going up and down twice per day: up
once as he passed under the nose of the rugby-ball, and up a second time
as he passed under its tail. This cartoon explanation is some way from
reality. In reality, the earth is not smooth, and it is not uniformly
covered by water (as you may have noticed). Two humps of water cannot
whoosh round the earth once per day because the continents get in the
way. The true behaviour of the tides is thus more complicated. In a
large body of water such as the Atlantic Ocean, tidal crests and troughs
form but, unable to whoosh round the earth, they do the next best thing:
they whoosh around the perimeter of the Ocean. In the North Atlantic
there are two crests and two troughs, all circling the Atlantic in an
anticlockwise direction once a

on the North pole, and the moon is 60 cm off the page to the right. The
earth spins once per day inside a rugby-ball-shaped shell of water. The
oceans are stretched towards and away from the moon because the
gravitational forces supplied by the moon don't perfectly match the
required centripetal force to keep the earth and moon whirling around
their common centre of gravity. Someone standing on the equator

two low waters per day.

day. Here in Britain we don't directly see these Atlantic crests and
troughs – we are set back from the Atlantic proper, separated from it by
a few hundred miles of paddling pool called the continental shelf. Each
time one of the crests whooshes by in the Atlantic proper, it sends a
crest up our paddling pool. Similarly each Atlantic trough sends a
trough up the paddling pool. Consecutive crests and troughs are
separated by six hours. Or to be more precise, by six and a quarter
hours, since the time between moon-rises is about 25, not 24 hours.

The speed at which the crests and troughs travel varies with the depth
of the paddling pool. The shallower the paddling pool gets, the slower
the crests and troughs travel and the larger they get. Out in the ocean,
the tides are just a foot or two in height. Arriving in European
estuaries, the tidal range is often as big as four metres. In the
northern hemisphere, the Coriolis force (a force, associated with the
rotation of the earth, that acts only on moving objects) makes all tidal
crests and troughs tend to hug the right-hand bank as they go. For
example, the tides in the English channel are bigger on the French side.
Similarly, the crests and troughs entering the North Sea around the
Orkneys hug the British side, travelling down to the Thames Estuary then
turning left at the Netherlands to pay their respects to Denmark.

Tidal energy is sometimes called lunar energy, since it's mainly thanks
to the moon that the water sloshes around so. Much of the tidal energy,
however, is really coming from the rotational energy of the spinning
earth. The earth is very gradually slowing down.

So, how can we put tidal energy to use, and how much power could we
extract?

Rough estimates of tidal power
------------------------------

When you think of tidal power, you might think of an artificial pool
next to the sea, with a water-wheel that is turned as the pool fills or
empties (images/figures 14.2 and 14.3). Chapter G shows how to estimate the
power avail- able from such tide-pools. Assuming a range of 4 m, a
typical range in many European estuaries, the maximum power of an
artificial tide-pool that's filled rapidly at high tide and emptied
rapidly at low tide, generating power from both flow directions, is
about 3 W/m^2^. This is the same as the power per unit area of an
offshore wind farm. And we already know how big offshore wind farms need
to be to make a difference. *They need to be country-sized*. So
similarly, to make tide-pools capable of producing power comparable to
Britain's total consumption, we'd need the total area of the tide-pools
to be similar to the area of Britain.

Amazingly, Britain is already supplied with a natural tide-pool of just
the required dimensions. This tide-pool is known as the North Sea
(images/figure 14.5). If we simply insert generators in appropriate spots,
significant power can be extracted. The generators might look like
underwater wind

mills. Because the density of water is roughly 1000 times that of air,
the power of water flow is 1000 times greater than the power of wind at
the same speed. We'll come back to tide farms in a moment, but first
let's discuss how much raw tidal energy rolls around Britain every day.

### Raw incoming tidal power

The tides around Britain are genuine tidal waves – unlike tsunamis,
which are called "tidal waves," but are nothing to do with tides. Follow
a high tide as it rolls in from the Atlantic. The time of high tide
becomes progress- ively later as we move east up the English channel
from the Isles of Scilly to Portsmouth and on to Dover. The crest of the
tidal wave progresses up the channel at about 70 km/h. (The crest of the
wave moves much faster than the water itself, just as ordinary waves on
the sea move faster than the water.) Similarly, a high tide moves
clockwise round Scotland, rolling down the North Sea from Wick to
Berwick and on to Hull at a speed of about 100 km/h. These two high
tides converge on the Thames Estuary. By coincidence, the Scottish crest
arrives about 12 hours later than the crest that came via Dover, so it
arrives in near-synchrony with the next high tide via Dover, and London
receives the normal two high tides per day.

The power we can extract from tides can never be more than the total
power of these tidal waves from the Atlantic. The total power crossing
the lines in figure 14.6 has been measured; on average it amounts to 100
kWh per day per person. If we imagine extracting 10% of this incident
energy, and if the conversion and transmission processes are 50%
efficient, the average power delivered would be 5 kWh per day per
person.

This is a tentative first guess, made without specifying any technical

Figure 14.5. The British Isles are in a fortunate position: the North
Sea forms a natural tide-pool, in and out of which great sloshes of
water pour twice a day.

these two lines has been measured to be 250 GW. This raw power, shared
between 60 million people, is 100 kWh per day per person.

details. Now let's estimate the power that could be delivered by three
specific solutions: tide farms, barrages, and offshore tidal lagoons.

Tidal stream farms
------------------

One way to extract tidal energy would be to build tide farms, just like
wind farms. The first such underwater windmill, or "tidal-stream"
generator, to be connected to the grid was a "300 kW" turbine, installed
in 2003 near the northerly city of Hammerfest, Norway. Detailed power
production results have not been published, and no-one has yet built a
tide farm with more than one turbine, so we're going to have to rely on
physics and guesswork to predict how much power tide farms could
produce. Assuming that the rules for laying out a sensible tide farm are
similar to those for wind farms, and that the efficiency of the tide
turbines will be like that of the best wind turbines, table 14.7 shows
the power of a tide farm for a few tidal currents.

Given that tidal currents of 2 to 3 knots are common, there are many
places around the British Isles where the power per unit area of tide
farm would be 6 W/m^2^ or more. This power per unit area can be compared
to our estimates for wind farms (2–3 W/m^2^) and for photovoltaic solar
farms (5–10 W/m^2^).

Tide power is not to be sneezed at! How would it add up, if we assume
that there are no economic obstacles to the exploitation of tidal power
at all the hot spots around the UK? Chapter G lists the flow speeds in
the best areas around the UK, and estimates that 9 kWh/d per person
could be extracted.

Barrages
--------

Tidal barrages are a proven technology. The famous barrage at La Rance
in France, where the tidal range is a whopping 8 metres on average, has
produced an average power of 60 MW since 1966. The tidal range in the
Severn Estuary is also unusually large. At Cardiff the range is 11.3 m
at spring tides, and 5.8 m at neaps. If a barrage were put across the
mouth of the Severn Estuary (from Weston-super-Mare to Cardiff), it
would make a 500 km^2^ tide-pool (images/figure 14.8). Notice how much bigger
this pool is than the estuary at La Rance. What power could this
tide-pool deliver, if we let the water in and out at the ideal times,
generating on both the flood and the ebb? According to the theoretical
numbers from table 14.4, when the range is 11.3 m, the average power
contributed by the barrage (at 30 W/m^2^) would be at most 14.5 GW, or
**5.8 kWh/d per person**. When the range is 5.8 m, the average power
contributed by the barrage (at 8 W/m^2^) would be at most 3.9 GW, or
**1.6 kWh/d per person**. These numbers assume that the water is let in
in a single pulse at the peak of high tide, and let out in a single
pulse at low tide. In practice, the in-flow and out-flow would be spread
over a few hours, which would reduce the power delivered a little.

The current proposals for the barrage will generate power in one
direction only. This reduces the power delivered by another 50%. The
engineers' reports on the proposed Severn barrage say that, generating
on the ebb alone, it would contribute 0.8 kWh/d per person on average.
The barrage would also provide protection from flooding valued at about
£120M per year.

Tidal lagoons
-------------

Tidal lagoons are created by building walls in the sea; they can then be
used like artificial estuaries. The required conditions for building
lagoons are that the water must be shallow and the tidal range must be
large. Economies of scale apply: big tidal lagoons make cheaper
electricity than small ones. The two main locations for large tidal
lagoons in Britain are the Wash on the east coast, and the waters off
Blackpool on the west coast (images/figure 14.9). Smaller facilities could be
built in north Wales, Lincolnshire, southwest Wales, and east Sussex.

If two lagoons are built in one location, a neat trick can be used to
boost the power delivered and to enable the lagoons to deliver power on
demand at any time, independent of the state of the tide. One lagoon can
be designated the "high" lagoon, and the other the "low" lagoon. At low
tide, some power generated by the emptying high lagoon can be used to

Figure 14.8. The Severn barrage proposals (bottom left), and Strangford
Lough, Northern Ireland (top left), shown on the same scale as the
barrage at La Rance (bottom right). The map shows two proposed locations
for a Severn barrage. A barrage at Weston-super-Mare would deliver an
average power of 2 GW (0.8 kWh/d per person). The outer alternative
would deliver twice as much. There is a big tidal resource in Northern
Ireland at Strangford Lough. Strangford Lough's area is 150 km^2^; the
tidal range in the Irish Sea outside is 4.5 m at springs and 1.5 m at
neaps – sadly not as big as the range at La Rance or the Severn. The raw
power of the natural tide-pool at Strangford Lough is roughly 150 MW,
which, shared between the 1.7 million people of Northern Ireland, comes
to 2 kWh/d per person. Strangford Lough is the location of the first
grid-connected tidal stream generator in the UK.

pump water *out* of the low lagoon, making its level even lower than low
water. The energy required to pump down the level of the low lagoon is
then repaid with interest at high tide, when power is generated by
letting water into the low lagoon. Similarly, extra water can be pumped
into the high lagoon at high tide, using energy generated by the low
lagoon. Whatever state the tide is in, one lagoon or the other would be
able to generate power. Such a pair of tidal lagoons could also work as
a pumped storage facility, storing excess energy from the electricity
grid.

The average power per unit area of tidal lagoons in British waters could
be 4.5W/m^2^, so if tidal lagoons with a total area of 800 km^2^ were
created (as indicated in figure 14.9), the power generated would be 1.5
kWh/d per person.

Beauties of tide
----------------

Totting everything up, the barrage, the lagoons, and the tidal stream
farms could deliver something like 11 kWh/d per person (images/figure 14.10).

Tide power has never been used on an industrial scale in Britain, so
it's hard to know what economic and technical challenges will be raised
as we build and maintain tide-turbines – corrosion, silt accumulation,
entanglement with flotsam? But here are seven reasons for being excited
about tidal power in the British Isles. 1. Tidal power is completely
predictable; unlike wind and sun, tidal power is a renewable on which
one could depend; it works day and night all year round; using tidal
lagoons, energy can be stored so that power can be delivered on demand.
2. Successive high and low tides take about 12 hours to progress around
the British Isles, so the strongest currents off Anglesey, Islay, Orkney
and Dover occur at different times from each other; thus, together, a
collection of tide farms could produce a more constant contribution to
the electrical grid than one tide farm, albeit a contribution that
wanders up and down with the phase of the moon. 3. Tidal power will last
for millions of years. 4. It doesn't require high-cost hardware, in
contrast to solar photovoltaic power. 5. Moreover, because the power
density of a typical tidal flow is greater than the power density of a
typical wind, a 1 MW tide turbine is smaller in size than a 1 MW wind
turbine; perhaps tide turbines could therefore be cheaper than wind
turbines. 6. Life below the waves is peaceful; there is no such thing as
a freak tidal storm; so, unlike wind turbines, which require costly
engineering to withstand rare windstorms, underwater tide turbines will
not require big safety factors in their design. 7. Humans mostly live on
the land, and they can't see under the sea, so objections to the visual
impact of tide turbines should be less strong than the objections to
wind turbines.
