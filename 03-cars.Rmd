#Cars

For our first chapter on consumption, let’s study that icon of modern
civilization: the car with a lone person in it.

How much power does a regular car-user consume? Once we know the conversion
rates, it’s simple arithmetic:

For the **distance travelled per day**, let’s use 50 km (30 miles).

For the **distance per unit of fuel**, also known as the **economy** of the
car, let’s use 33 miles per UK gallon (taken from an advertisement for a family
car):

33 miles per imperial gallon ≈ 12 km per litre.

(The symbol ≈ means "is approximately equal to." )

What about the **energy per unit of fuel** (also called the **calorific
value**or **energy density**)? Instead of looking it up, it’s fun to estimate
this sort of quantity by a bit of lateral thinking. Automobile fuels (whether
diesel or petrol) are all hydrocarbons; and hydrocarbons can also be found on
our breakfast table, with the calorific value conveniently written on the
side:roughly 8 kWh per kg (images/figure 3.2). Since we’ve estimated the
economy of the car in miles per unit *volume* of fuel, we need to express the
calorific value as an energy per unit *volume*. To turn our fuel’s "8 kWh per
kg" (an energy per unit *mass*) into an energy per unit volume, we need to know
the density of the fuel. What’s the density of butter? Well, butter just floats
on water, as do fuel-spills, so its density must be a little less than
water’s,which is 1 kg per litre. If we guess a density of 0.8 kg per litre, we
obtain a calorific value of:

8 kWh per kg × 0.8 kg per litre ≈ 7 kWh per litre.

Rather than willfully perpetuate an inaccurate estimate, let’s switch to the
actual value, for petrol, of 10 kWh per litre.

Congratulations! We’ve made our first estimate of consumption. I’ve dis-played
this estimate in the left-hand stack in figure 3.3. The red box’s height
represents 40 kWh per day per person.

Figure 3.2. Want to know the energy in car fuel? Look at the label on a pack of
butter or margarine. The calorific value is 3000 kJ per 100 g, or about 8 kWh
per kg.

Figure 3.3. Chapter 3’s conclusion: atypical car-driver uses about 40 kWh per
day.

This is the estimate for a typical car-driver driving a typical car today.Later
chapters will discuss the *average* consumption of all the people in Britain,
taking into account the fact that not everyone drives. We’ll also discuss in
Part II what the consumption *could* be, with the help of other technologies
such as electric cars.

Why does the car deliver 33 miles per gallon? Where’s that energy going? Could
we manufacture cars that do 3300 miles per gallon? If we are interested in
trying to reduce cars’ consumption, we need to understand the physics behind
cars’ consumption. These questions are answered in the accompanying technical
chapter A (p254), which provides a cartoon theory of cars’ consumption. I
encourage you to read the technical chapters if formulae like ^1^⁄~2~mv^2^
don’t give you medical problems.

Chapter 3’s conclusion: a typical car-driver uses about 40 kWh per day. Next we
need to get the sustainable-production stack going, so we have something to
compare this estimate with.

Queries -------

#### What about the energy-cost of producing the car’s fuel?

Good point. When I estimate the energy consumed by a particular activity, I
tend to choose a fairly tight "boundary" around the activity.This choice makes
the estimation easier, but I agree that it’s a good idea to try to estimate the
full energy impact of an activity. It’s been estimated that making each unit of
petrol requires an input of 1.4 units of oil and other primary fuels (Treloar
et al., 2004).

#### What about the energy-cost of manufacturing the car?

Yes, that cost fell outside the boundary of this calculation too. We’ll talk
about car-making in Chapter 15.

29 *For the distance travelled per day, let’s use 50 km.* This corresponds to18
000 km (11 000 miles) per year. Roughly half of the British population drive to
work. The total amount of car travel in the UK is 686 billion passenger-km per
year, which corresponds to an "average distance traveled by car per British
person" of 30 km per day. Source: Department for Transport [5647rh]. As I said
on p22, I aim to estimate the consumption of a"typical moderately-affluent
person" – the consumption that many people aspire to. Some people don’t drive
much. In this chapter, I want to estimate the energy consumed by someone who
chooses to drive, rather than depersonalize the answer by reporting the UK
average, which mixes together the drivers and non-drivers. If I said "the
average use of energy for car driving

census.

in the UK is 24 kWh/d per person," I bet some people would
misunderstand and say: "I’m a car driver so I guess I use 24
kWh/d." [^**E**^](http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#31)

29*... let’s use 33 miles per UK gallon.* In the European language, this is 8.6
liters per 100 km. 33 miles per gallon was the average for UK cars in 2005
[27jdc5].Petrol cars have an average fuel consumption of 31 mpg; diesel cars,
39 mpg; new petrol cars (less than two years old), 32 mpg (Dept. for Transport,
2007).Honda, "the most fuel-efficient auto company in America," records that
its fleet of new cars sold in 2005 has an average top-level fuel economy of
35 miles per UK gallon [28abpm].

29*Let’s guess a density of 0.8 kg per litre.* Petrol’s density is 0.737.
Diesel’s is0.820–0.950 [nmn4l].

–*... the actual value of 10 kWh per litre.* ORNL [2hcgdh] provide the
following calorific values: diesel: 10.7 kWh/l; jet fuel: 10.4 kWh/l; petrol:
9.7 kWh/l.When looking up calorific values, you’ll find "gross calorific value"
and"net calorific value" listed (also known as "high heat value" and "low heat
value" ). These differ by only 6% for motor fuels, so it’s not crucial to
distinguish them here, but let me explain anyway. The gross calorific value is
the actual chemical energy released when the fuel is burned. One of the
products of combustion is water, and in most engines and power stations, part
of the energy goes into vaporizing this water. The net calorific value measure
show much energy is left over assuming this energy of vaporization is discarded
and wasted.When we ask "how much energy does my lifestyle consume?" the gross
calorific value is the right quantity to use. The net calorific value, on the
other hand, is of interest to a power station engineer, who needs to decide
which fuel to burn in his power station. Throughout this book I’ve tried to use
gross calorific values.A final note for party-pooping pedants who say "butter
is not a hydrocarbon" :OK, butter is not a pure hydrocarbon; but it’s a good
approximation to say that the main component of butter is long hydrocarbon
chains, just like petrol. The proof of the pudding is, this approximation got
us within 30%of the correct answer. Welcome to guerrilla physics.
