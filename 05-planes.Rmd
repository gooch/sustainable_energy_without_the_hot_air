#Planes

Imagine that you make one intercontinental trip per year by plane.
Howmuch energy does that cost?

A Boeing 747-400 with 240 000 litres of fuel carries 416 passengers
about8 800 miles (14 200 km). And fuel's calorific value is 10 kWh per
litre. (Welearned that in Chapter 3.) So the energy cost of one
full-distance roundtripon such a plane, if divided equally among the
passengers, is

2 × 240 000 litre

× 10 kWh/litre ≈ 12 000 kWh per passenger

416 passengers

If you make one such trip per year, then your average energy
consumptionper day is

12 000 kWh

≈ 33 kWh/day

365 days

14 200 km is a little further than London to Cape Town (10 000 km)
andLondon to Los Angeles (9000km), so I think we've slightly
overestimatedthe distance of a typical long-range intercontinental trip;
but we've alsooverestimated the fullness of the plane, and the energy
cost per person ismore if the plane's not full. Scaling down by 10 000
km/14 200 km to get anestimate for Cape Town, then up again by 100/80 to
allow for the plane'sbeing 80% full, we arrive at 29 kWh per day. For
ease of memorization, I'llround this up to 30 kWh per day.

Let's make clear what this means. Flying once per year has an energycost
slightly bigger than leaving a 1 kW electric fire on, non-stop, 24
hoursa day, all year.

Just as Chapter 3, in which we estimated consumption by cars,
wasaccompanied by Chapter A, offering a model of where the energy goes
incars, this chapter's technical partner (Chapter C, p269), discusses
wherethe energy goes in planes. Chapter C allows us to answer questions
suchas "would air travel consume significantly less energy if we
travelled inslower planes?"  The answer is **no**: in contrast to wheeled
vehicles, whichcan get more efficient the slower they go, planes are
already almost asenergy-efficient as they could possibly be. Planes
unavoidably have to useenergy for two reasons: they have to throw air
down in order to stay up,and they need energy to overcome air
resistance. No redesign of a planeis going to radically improve its
efficiency. A 10% improvement? Yes,possible. A doubling of efficiency?
I'd eat my complimentary socks.

facturers [www.q400.com], uses 3.81 litres per 100 passenger-km (at a
cruisespeed of 667 km/h), which is an energy cost of 38 kWh per 100
p-km. Thefull 747 has an energy cost of 42 kWh per 100 p-km. So both
planes aretwice as fuel-efficient as a single-occupancy car. (The car
I'm assuminghere is the average European car that we discussed in
Chapter 3.)

#### Is flying extra-bad for climate change in some way?

Yes, that's the experts' view, though uncertainty remains about
thistopic [3fbufz]. Flying creates other greenhouse gases in addition to
CO~2~,such as water and ozone, and indirect greenhouse gases, such as
nitrousoxides. If you want to estimate your carbon footprint in tons of
CO~2~-equivalent, then you should take the actual CO~2~ emissions of
your flightsand bump them up two- or three-fold. This book's diagrams
don't includethat multiplier because here we are focusing on our
*energy* balance sheet.

35*Boeing 747-400* – data are from [9ehws]. Planes today are not
completely full. Airlines are proud if their average full-ness is 80%.
Easyjet planes are 85% full on average. (Source: thelondonpaperTuesday
16th January, 2007.) An 80%-full 747 uses about 53 kWh per
100passenger-km. What about short-haul flights? In 2007, Ryanair,
"Europe's greenest airline," delivered transportation at a cost of 37 kWh
per 100 p-km [3exmgv]. Thismeans that flying across Europe with Ryanair
has much the same energycost as having all the passengers drive to their
destination in cars, two to acar. (For an indication of what other
airlines might be delivering, Ryanair'sfuel burn rate in 2000, before
their environment-friendly investments, wasabove 73 kWh per 100 p-km.)
London to Rome is 1430 km; London to Malagais 1735 km. So a round-trip
to Rome with the greenest airline has an energycost of 1050 kWh, and a
round-trip to Malaga costs 1270 kWh. If you popover to Rome and to
Malaga once per year, your average power consumptionis 6.3 kWh/d with
the greenest airline, and perhaps 12 kWh/d with a lessgreen one. What
about frequent flyers? To get a silver frequent flyer card from an
in-tercontinental airline, it seems one must fly around 25 000 miles per
year ineconomy class. That's about 60 kWh per day, if we scale up the
openingnumbers from this chapter and assume planes are 80% full. Here are
some additional figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-mate
Change [yrnmum]: a full 747-400 travelling 10 000 km with
low-densityseating (262 seats) has an energy consumption of 50 kWh per
100 p-km. Ina high-density seating configuration (568 seats) and
travelling 4000 km, the

short-haul Tupolev-154 travelling 2235 km with 70% of its 164 seats
occupied con-sumes 80 kWh per 100 p-km.

35*No redesign of a plane is going to radically improve its efficiency.*
Actually,the Advisory Council for Aerospace Research in Europe (ACARE)
targetis for an overall 50% reduction in fuel burned per passenger-km by
2020(relative to a 2000 baseline), with 15–20% improvement expected in
engineefficiency. As of 2006, Rolls Royce is half way to this engine
target [36w5gz]. Dennis Bushnell, chief scientist at NASA's Langley
Research Center, seems toagree with my overall assessment of prospects
for efficiency improvementsin aviation. The aviation industry is mature.
"There is not much left to gainexcept by the glacial accretion of a per
cent here and there over long timeperiods."  (New Scientist, 24 February
2007, page 33.) The radically reshaped "Silent Aircraft" 
[silentaircraft.org/sax40], if itwere built, is predicted to be 16% more
efficient than a conventional-shapedplane (Nickol, 2008). If the ACARE
target is reached, it's presumably going to be thanks mostlyto having
fuller planes and better air-traffic management.
