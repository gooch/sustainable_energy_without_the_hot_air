#Hydroelectricity

To make hydroelectric power, you need altitude, and you need
rainfall. Let's estimate the total energy of all the rain as it runs down
to sea-level.

For this hydroelectric forecast, I'll divide Britain into two: the
lower, dryer bits, which I'll call "the lowlands;" and the higher, wetter
bits, which I'll call "the highlands." I'll choose Bedford and Kinlochewe
as my representatives of these two regions.

Let's do the lowlands first. To estimate the gravitational power of
low-land rain, we multiply the rainfall in Bedford (584 mm per year) by
the density of water (1000 kg/m^3^), the strength of gravity (10 m/s^2^)
and the typical lowland altitude above the sea (say 100 m). The power per
unit area works out to 0.02 W/m^2^. That's the power per unit area of
land on which rain falls.

When we multiply this by the area per person (2700 m^2^, if the
lowlands are equally shared between all 60 million Brits), we find an
average raw power of about 1 kWh per day per person. This is the absolute
upper limit for lowland hydroelectric power, if every river were dammed
and every drop perfectly exploited. Realistically, we will only ever dam
rivers with substantial height drops, with catchment areas much smaller
than the whole country. Much of the water evaporates before it gets
anywhere near a turbine, and no hydroelectric system exploits the full
potential energy of the water. We thus arrive at a firm conclusion about
lowland water power. People may enjoy making "run-of-the-river" hydro and
other small-scale hydroelectric schemes, but such lowland facilities can
never deliver more than 1 kWh per day per person.

land area there is at each height.

Let's turn to the highlands. Kinlochewe is a rainier spot: it gets 2278
mm per year, four times more than Bedford. The height drops there are
bigger too – large areas of land are above 300 m. So overall a
twelve-fold increase in power per square metre is plausible for
mountainous regions. The raw power per unit area is roughly 0.24 W/m^2^.
If the highlands generously share their hydro-power with the rest of the
UK (at 1300 m^2^ area per per-son), we find an upper limit of about 7
kWh per day per person. As in the lowlands, this is the upper limit on
raw power if evaporation were outlawed and every drop were perfectly
exploited.

What should we estimate is the plausible practical limit? Let's guess20%
of this – 1.4 kWh per day, and round it up a little to allow for
production in the lowlands: 1.5 kWh per day.

The actual power from hydroelectricity in the UK today is 0.2 kWh/d per
person, so this 1.5 kWh/d per person would require a seven-fold
in-crease in hydroelectric power.

55*Rainfall* statistics are from the BBC weather centre.

56*The raw power per unit area [of Highland rain] is roughly 0.24
W/m^2^*. We can check this estimate against the actual power density of
the Loch Slo hydro-electric scheme, completed in 1950 (Ross, 2008). The
catchment area of Loch Sloy is about 83 km^2^; the rainfall there is
about 2900 mm per year(a bit higher than the 2278 mm/y of Kinlochewe);
and the electricity output in 2006 was 142 GWh per year, which
corresponds to a power density of0.2W per m^2^ of catchment area. Loch
Sloy's surface area is about 1.5 km^2^, so the hydroelectric facility
itself has a[^**E**^](http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#56) per
unit lake area of 11 W/m^2^. So the hillsides, aqueducts, and tunnels
bringing water to Loch Sloy act like a55-fold power concentrator.

–*The actual power from hydroelectricity in the UK today is 0.2 kWh per
day per person*. Source: MacLeay et al. (2007). In 2006, large-scale
hydro produced 3515 GWh (from plant with a capacity of 1.37 GW);
small-scale hydro,212 GWh (0.01 kWh/d/p) (from a capacity of 153 MW). In
1943, when the growth of hydroelectricity was in full swing, the North of
Scotland Hydroelectricity Board's engineers estimated that the
Highlands of Scotland could produce 6.3 TWh per year in 102 facilities –
that would correspond to 0.3 kWh/d per person in the UK (Ross,
2008). Glendoe, the first new large-scale hydroelectric project in the UK
since 1957, will add capacity of 100 MW and is expected to deliver 180
GWh per year. Glendoe's catchment area is 75 km^2^, so its power density
works out to 0.27 W per m^2^ of catchment area. Glendoe has been billed
as "big enough to power Glasgow." But if we share its 180 GWh per year
across the population of Glasgow (616 000 people), we get only 0.8 kWh/d
per person. That is just5% of the average electricity consumption of 17
kWh/d per person. The 20-fold exaggeration is achieved by focusing on
Glendoe's peak output rather than its average, which is 5 times smaller;
and by discussing "homes" rather than the total electrical power of
Glasgow (see p329).
