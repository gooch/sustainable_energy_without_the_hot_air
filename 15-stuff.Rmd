#Stuff

One of the main sinks of energy in the “developed” world is the creation
of stuff. In its natural life cycle, stuff passes through three stages.
First, a new-born stuff is displayed in shiny packaging on a shelf in a
shop. At this stage, stuff is called “goods.” As soon as the stuff is
taken home and sheds its packaging, it undergoes a transformation from
“goods” to its second form, “clutter.” The clutter lives with its owner
for a period of months or years. During this period, the clutter is
largely ignored by its owner, who is off at the shops buying more goods.
Eventually, by a miracle of modern alchemy, the clutter is transformed
into its final form, rubbish. To the untrained eye, it can be difficult
to distinguish this “rubbish” from the highly desirable “good” that it
used to be. Nonetheless, at this stage the discerning owner pays the
dustman to transport the stuff away.

Let’s say we want to understand the full energy-cost of a stuff, perhaps
with a view to designing better stuff. This is called life-cycle
analysis. It’s conventional to chop the energy-cost of anything from a
hair-dryer to a cruise-ship into four chunks:

**Phase R:** Making **raw materials**. This phase involves digging
minerals out of the ground, melting them, purifying them, and modifying
them into manufacturers’ lego: plastics, glasses, metals, and ceramics,
for example. The energy costs of this phase include the transportation
costs of trundling the raw materials to their next destination.

**Phase P: Production**. In this phase, the raw materials are processed
into a manufactured product. The factory where the hair-dryer’s coils
are wound, its graceful lines moulded, and its components carefully
snapped together, uses heat and light. The energy costs of this phase
include packaging and more transportation.

**Phase U: Use**. Hair-dryers and cruise-ships both guzzle energy when
they’re used as intended.

**Phase D: Disposal**. This phase includes the energy cost of putting
the stuff back in a hole in the ground (landfill), or of turning the
stuff back into raw materials (recycling); and of cleaning up all the
pollution associated with the stuff.

To understand how much energy a stuff’s life requires, we should
estimate the energy costs of all four phases and add them up. Usually
one of these four phases dominates the total energy cost, so to get a
reasonable estimate of the total energy cost we need accurate estimates
only of the cost of that dominant phase. If we wish to redesign a stuff
so as to reduce its total energy cost, we should usually focus on
reducing the cost of the dominant phase, while making sure that
energy-savings in that phase

aren’t being undone by accompanying increases in the energy costs of the
other three phases.

Rather than estimating in detail how much power the perpetual produc-
tion and transport of all stuff requires, let’s first cover just a few
common examples: drink containers, computers, batteries, junk mail,
cars, and houses. This chapter focuses on the energy costs of phases R
and P. These energy costs are sometimes called the “embodied” or
“embedded” energy of the stuff – slightly confusing names, since usually
that energy is neither literally embodied nor embedded in the stuff.

### Drink containers

Let’s assume you have a coke habit: you drink five cans of multinational
chemicals per day, and throw the aluminium cans away. For this stuff,
it’s the raw material phase that dominates. The production of metals is
energy intensive, especially for aluminium. Making one aluminium
drinks-can needs 0.6 kWh. So a five-a-day habit wastes energy at a rate
of 3 kWh/d.

As for a 500 ml water bottle made of PET (which weighs 25 g), the
embodied energy is 0.7 kWh – just as bad as an aluminium can!

### Other packaging

The average Brit throws away 400 g of packaging per day – mainly food
packaging. The embodied energy content of packaging ranges from 7 to 20
kWh per kg as we run through the spectrum from glass and paper to
plastics and steel cans. Taking the typical embodied energy content to
be 10 kWh/kg, we deduce that the energy footprint of packaging is 4
kWh/d. A little of this embodied energy is recoverable by waste
incineration, as we’ll discuss in Chapter 27.

### Computers

Making a personal computer costs 1800 kWh of energy. So if you buy a new
computer every two years, that corresponds to a power consumption of 2.5
kWh per day.

### Batteries

The energy cost of making a rechargeable nickel-cadmium AA battery,
storing 0.001 kWh of electrical energy and having a mass of 25 g, is 1.4
kWh (phases R and P). If the energy cost of disposable batteries is
similar, throwing away two AA batteries per month uses about 0.1 kWh/d.
The energy cost of batteries is thus likely to be a minor item in your
stack of energy consumption.

Freight transport is measured in ton-kilometres (t-km). If one ton of
Cornish pasties are transported 580 km (images/figure 15.5) then we say 580
t-km of freight transport have been achieved. The energy intensity of
road trans- port in the UK is about 1 kWh per t-km.

When the container ship in figure 15.6 transports 50 000 tons of cargo a
distance of 10 000 km, it achieves 500 million t-km of freight
transport. The energy intensity of freight transport by this container
ship is 0.015 kWh per t-km. Notice how much more efficient transport by
container-ship is than transport by road. These energy intensities are
displayed in figure 15.8.

### Transport of stuff by road

In 2006, the total amount of road transport in Britain by heavy goods
vehi- cles was 156 billion t-km. Shared between 60 million, that comes
to 7 t-km per day per person, which costs 7 kWh per day per person
(assuming an energy intensity of 1 kWh per ton-km). One quarter of this
transport, by the way, was of food, drink, and tobacco.

### Transport by water

In 2002, 560 million tons of freight passed through British ports. The
Tyn- dall Centre calculated that Britain’s share of the energy cost of
international shipping is 4 kWh/d per person.

### Transport of water; taking the pee

Water’s not a very glamorous stuff, but we use a lot of it – about 160
litres

per day per person. In turn, we provide about 160 litres per day per
person of sewage to the water companies. The cost of pumping water
around the country and treating our sewage is about 0.4 kWh per day per
person.

### Desalination

At the moment the UK doesn’t spend energy on water desalination. But
there’s talk of creating desalination plants in London. What’s the
energy cost of turning salt water into drinking water? The least
energy-intensive method is reverse osmosis. Take a membrane that lets
through only water, put salt water on one side of it, and pressurize the
salt water. Water reluctantly oozes through the membrane, producing
purer water – reluc- tantly, because pure water separated from salt has
low entropy, and nature prefers high entropy states where everything is
mixed up. We must pay high-grade energy to achieve unmixing.

The Island of Jersey has a desalination plant that can produce 6000 m^3^
of pure water per day (images/figure 15.10). Including the pumps for bringing
the water up from the sea and through a series of filters, the whole
plant uses a power of 2 MW. That’s an energy cost of 8 kWh per m^3^ of
water produced. At a cost of 8 kWh per m^3^, a daily water consumption
of 160 litres would require 1.3 kWh per day.

freight-transport. The vertical coordinate shows the energy consumed in
kWh per net ton-km, (that is, the energy per t-km of freight moved, not
including the weight of the vehicle). See also figure 20.23 (energy
requirements of passenger transport).

Water transport requires energy because boats make waves. Nevertheless,
transporting freight by ship is surprisingly energy efficient.

Stuff retail
------------

Supermarkets in the UK consume about 11 TWh of energy per year. Shared
out equally between 60 million happy shoppers, that’s a power of 0.5 kWh
per day per person.

The significance of imported stuff
----------------------------------

In standard accounts of “Britain’s energy consumption” or “Britain’s
carbon footprint,” imported goods are *not* counted. Britain used to
make its own gizmos, and our per-capita footprint in 1910 was as big as
America’s is today. Now Britain doesn’t manufacture so much (so our
energy consumption and carbon emissions have dropped a bit), but we
still love gizmos, and we get them made for us by other countries.
Should we ignore the energy cost of making the gizmo, because it’s
imported? I don’t think so. Dieter Helm and his colleagues in Oxford
estimate that under a correct account, allowing for imports and exports,
Britain’s carbon foot- print is nearly *doubled* from the official “11
tons CO~2~e per person” to about 21 tons. This implies that the biggest
item in the average British person’s energy footprint is the energy cost
of making imported stuff.

In Chapter H, I explore this idea further, by looking at the weight of
Britain’s imports. Leaving aside our imports of fuels, we import a
little

desalination plant. The pump in the foreground, right, has a power of
355 kW and shoves seawater at a pressure of 65 bar into 39 spiral-wound
membranes in the banks of blue horizontal tubes, left, delivering 1500
m^3^ per day of clean water. The clean water from this facility has a
total energy cost of 8 kWh per m^3^.

over 2 tons per person of stuff every year, of which about 1.3 tons per
per- son are processed and manufactured stuff like vehicles, machinery,
white goods, and electrical and electronic equipment. That’s about 4 kg
per day per person of processed stuff. Such goods are mainly made of
materials whose production required at least 10 kWh of energy per kg of
stuff. I thus estimate that this pile of cars, fridges, microwaves,
computers, photo- copiers and televisions has an embodied energy of at
least 40 kWh per day per person.

To summarize all these forms of stuff and stuff-transport, I will put on
the consumption stack 48 kWh per day per person for the making of stuff
(made up of at least 40 for imports, 2 for a daily newspaper, 2 for
road- making, 1 for house-making, and 3 for packaging); and another 12
kWh per day per person for the transport of the stuff by sea, by road,
and by pipe, and the storing of food in supermarkets.

vary between mills and between countries. 5 kWh/kg is the figure for a
Swedish newspaper mill in 1973 from Norrström (1980), who estimated that
efficiency measures could reduce the cost to about 3.2 kWh/kg. A more
recent full life-cycle analysis (Denison, 1997) estimates the net energy

5200 m^3^ carries 3360 deadweight tons. (Dead- weight tonnage is the
mass of cargo that the ship can carry.) It travels at speed 13 kn (24
