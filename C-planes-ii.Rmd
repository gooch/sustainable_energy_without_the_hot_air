What are the fundamental limits of travel by flying? Does the physics of
flight require an unavoidable use of a certain amount of energy, per
ton, per kilometre flown? What's the maximum distance a 300-ton Boeing
747 can fly? What about a 1-kg bar-tailed godwit or a 100-gram Arctic
tern?

Just as Chapter 3, in which we estimated consumption by cars, was
followed by Chapter A, offering a model of where the energy goes in
cars, this chapter fills out Chapter 5, discussing where the energy goes
in planes. The only physics required is Newton's laws of motion, which
I'll describe when they're needed.

This discussion will allow us to answer questions such as "would air
travel consume much less energy if we travelled in slower
propellor-driven planes?" There's a lot of equations ahead: I hope you
enjoy them!

How to fly
----------

Planes (and birds) move through air, so, just like cars and trains, they
experience a drag force, and much of the energy guzzled by a plane goes
into pushing the plane along against this force. Additionally, unlike
cars and trains, planes have to expend energy *in order to stay up*.

Planes stay up by throwing air down. When the plane pushes down on air,
the air pushes up on the plane (because Newton's third law tells it to).
As long as this upward push, which is called lift, is big enough to
balance the downward weight of the plane, the plane avoids plummeting
downwards.

When the plane throws air down, it gives that air kinetic energy. So
creating lift requires energy. The total power required by the plane is
the sum of the power required to create lift and the power required to
overcome ordinary drag. (The power required to create lift is usually
called "induced drag," by the way. But I'll call it the lift power,
*P*~lift~.)

The two equations we'll need, in order to work out a theory of flight,
are Newton's second law:

force = rate of change of momentum

(C.1)

![](images/figure270.png)

Figure C.1. Birds: two Arctic terns, a bar-tailed godwit, and a Boeing
747.

![](images/figure271.png) ![](figure272.png)

and Newton's third law, which I just mentioned:

force exerted on A by B = − force exerted on B by A

(C.2)

If you don't like equations, I can tell you the punchline now: we're
going to find that the power required to create lift turns out to be
*equal* to the power required to overcome drag. So the requirement to
"stay up" *doubles* the power required.

Let's make a cartoon of the lift force on a plane moving at speed *v*.
In a time *t* the plane moves a distance *vt* and leaves behind it a
sausage of downward-moving air (images/figure C.2). We'll call the
cross-sectional area of this sausage *A*~s~. This sausage's diameter is
roughly equal to the wingspan *w* of the plane. (Within this large
sausage is a smaller sausage of swirling turbulent air with
cross-sectional area similar to the frontal area of the plane's body.)
Actually, the details of the air flow are much more interest- ing than
this sausage picture: each wing tip leaves behind it a vortex, with the
air between the wingtips moving down fast, and the air beyond (outside)
the wingtips moving up (images/figures C.3 & C.4). This upward-moving air is
exploited by birds flying in formation: just behind the tip of a bird's
wing is a sweet little updraft. Anyway, let's get back to our sausage.

The sausage's mass is

*m*~sausage~ = density × volume = *ρvtA*~s~

(C.3)

Let's say the whole sausage is moving down with speed *u*, and figure
out what *u* needs to be in order for the plane to experience a lift
force equal to

Figure C.2. A plane encounters a stationary tube of air. Once the plane
has passed by, the air has been thrown downwards by the plane. The force
exerted by the plane on the air to accelerate it downwards is equal and
opposite to the upwards force exerted on the plane by the air.

Figure C.3. Our cartoon assumes that the plane leaves a sausage of air
moving down in its wake. A realistic picture involves a more complex
swirling flow. For the real thing, see figure C.4.

Center.

if the plane turned its fuel's power into drag power and lift power
perfectly efficiently. (Incidentally, another name for "energy per
distance travelled" is "force," and we can recognize the two terms above
as the dragforce ^1^⁄~2~*c*~d~*ρA*~p~*v*^2^and the lift-related force
^1^⁄~2~(*mg*)^2^/(*ρv*^2^*A*~s~). The sum is the force, or "thrust,"
that specifies exactly how hard the engines have to push.)

Real jet engines have an efficiency of about *ε* = 1/3, so the
energy-per- distance of a plane travelling at speed *v* is

![](E147-0-0.png)

(C.14)

This energy-per-distance is fairly complicated; but it simplifies
greatly if we assume that the plane is *designed* to fly at the speed
that *minimizes* the energy-per-distance. The energy-per-distance, you
see, has got a sweet- spot as a function of *v* (images/figure C.5). The sum of
the two quantities ^1^⁄~2~*c*~d~*ρA*~p~*v*^2^ and
^1^⁄~2~(*mg*)^2^/(*ρv*^2^*A*~s~)is smallest when the two quantities are
equal. This phenomenon is delightfully common in physics and
engineering: two things that don't obviously *have* to be equal *are*
actually equal, or equal within a factor of 2.

So, this equality principle tells us that the optimum speed for the
plane is such that

![](E150-0-0.png)

(C.15)

i.e.

![](E151-0-0.png)

(C.16)

This defines the optimum speed if our cartoon of flight is accurate; the
cartoon breaks down if the engine efficiency *ε* depends significantly
on speed, or if the speed of the plane exceeds the speed of sound (330
m/s); above the speed of sound, we would need a different model of drag
and lift.

Let's check our model by seeing what it predicts is the optimum speed
for a 747 and for an albatross. We must take care to use the correct
air- density: if we want to estimate the optimum cruising speed for a
747 at 30 000 feet, we must remember that air density drops with
increasing al- titude *z* as exp(−*mgz*/*kT*), where *m* is the mass of
nitrogen or oxygen molecules, and *kT* is the thermal energy
(Boltzmann's constant times ab- solute temperature). The density is
about 3 times smaller at that altitude.

The predicted optimal speeds (table C.6) are more accurate than we have
a right to expect! The 747's optimal speed is predicted to be 540mph,
and the albatross's, 32mph – both very close to the true cruising speeds
of the two birds (560mph and 30–55mph respectively).

Let's explore a few more predictions of our cartoon. We can check
whether the force (C.13) is compatible with the known thrust of the 747.
Remembering that at the optimal speed, the two forces are equal, we just

![](images/figure275-2-0.png)

Figure C.5. The force required to keep a plane moving, as a function of
its speed *v*, is the sum of an ordinary drag force
^1^⁄~2~*c*~d~ρ*A*~p~*v*^2^ – which increases with speed – and the
lift-related force (also known as the induced drag)

 --- ---------------
 1  (*mg*)^2^
 2  *ρv*^2^*A*~s~
 --- ---------------

– which decreases with speed. There is an ideal speed, *v*~optimal~, at
which the force required is minimized. The force is an energy per
distance, so minimizing the force also minimizes the fuel per distance.
To optimize the fuel efficiency, fly at *v*~optimal~. This graph shows
our cartoon's estimate of the thrust required, in kilonewtons, for a
Boeing 747 of mass 319 t, wingspan 64.4 m, drag coefficient 0.03, and
frontal area 180 m^2^, travelling in air of density *ρ* = 0.41 kg/m^3^
(the density at a height of 10 km), as a function of its speed *v* in
m/s. Our model has an optimal speed *v*~optimal~ = 220 m/s (540 mph).
For a cartoon based on sausages, this is a good match to real life!

Let's define the filling factor *f*~A~ to be the area ratio:

![](E155-0-0.png)

(C.21)

(Think of *f*~A~ as the fraction of the square occupied by the plane in
figure C.7.) Then

force  =  (*c*~d~*f*~A~)^1/2^(*mg)*.

(C.22)

Interesting! Independent of the density of the fluid through which the
plane flies, the required thrust (for a plane travelling at the optimal
speed) is just a dimensionless constant (*c*~d~*f*~A~)^1/2^ times the
weight of the plane. This constant, by the way, is known as the
drag-to-lift ratio of the plane. (The lift-to-drag ratio has a few other
names: the glide number, glide ratio, aerodynamic efficiency, or
finesse; typical values are shown in table C.8.)

Taking the jumbo jet's figures, *c*~d~ ≅ 0.03 and *f*~A~ ≅ 0.04, we find
the required thrust is

(*c*~d~*f*~A~)^1/2^ *mg* = 0.036 *mg* = 130 kN

(C.23)

How does this agree with the 747's spec sheets? In fact each of the 4
engines has a maximum thrust of about 250 kN, but this maximum thrust is
used only during take-off. During cruise, the thrust is much smaller:

Table C.8. Lift-to-drag ratios.

the thrust of a cruising 747 is 200 kN, just 50% more than our cartoon
suggested. Our cartoon is a little bit off because our estimate of the
drag- to-lift ratio was a little bit low.

This thrust can be used directly to deduce the transport efficiency
achieved by any plane. We can work out two sorts of transport
efficiency: the energy cost of moving *weight* around, measured in kWh
per ton-kilometre; and the energy cost of moving people, measured in kWh
per 100 passenger-kilometres.

### Efficiency in weight terms

Thrust is a force, and a force is an energy per unit distance. The total
energy used per unit distance is bigger by a factor (1/*ε*), where *ε*
is the efficiency of the engine, which we'll take to be 1/3.

Here's the gross transport cost, defined to be the energy per unit
weight (of the entire craft) per unit distance:

![](E162-0-0.png)

(C.24)

(C.25)

(C.26)

So the transport cost is just a dimensionless quantity (related to a
plane's shape and its engine's efficiency), multiplied by *g*, the
acceleration due to gravity. Notice that this gross transport cost
applies to all planes, but depends only on three simple properties of
the plane: its drag coefficient, the shape of the plane, and its engine
efficiency. It doesn't depend on the size of the plane, nor on its
weight, nor on the density of air. If we plug in *ε* = 1/3 and assume a
lift-to-drag ratio of 20 we find the gross transport cost of *any*
plane, according to our cartoon, is

0.15 *g*

or

0.4 kWh/ton-km.

### Can planes be improved?

If engine efficiency can be boosted only a tiny bit by technological
progress, and if the shape of the plane has already been essentially
perfected, then there is little that can be done about the dimensionless
quantity. The trans- port efficiency is close to its physical limit. The
aerodynamics community say that the shape of planes could be improved a
little by a switch to blended-wing bodies, and that the drag coefficient
could be reduced a

![](images/figure277.png)

little by laminar flow control, a technology that reduces the growth of
tur- bulence over a wing by sucking a little air through small
perforations in the surface (Braslow, 1999). Adding laminar flow control
to existing planes would deliver a 15% improvement in drag coefficient,
and the change of shape to blended-wing bodies is predicted to improve
the drag coefficient by about 18% (Green, 2006). And equation (C.26)
says that the transport cost is proportional to the square root of the
drag coefficient, so improve- ments of *c*~d~ by 15% or 18% would
improve transport cost by 7.5% and 9% respectively.

This gross transport cost is the energy cost of moving weight around,
*including the weight of the plane itself*. To estimate the energy
required to move freight by plane, per unit weight of freight, we need
to divide by the fraction that is cargo. For example, if a full 747
freighter is about 1/3 cargo, then its transport cost is

0.45 *g*,

or roughly 1.2 kWh/ton-km. This is just a little bigger than the
transport cost of a truck, which is 1 kWh/ton-km.

### Transport efficiency in terms of bodies

Similarly, we can estimate a passenger transport-efficiency for a 747.

![](E168-0-0.png)

(C.27)

(C.28)

(C.29)

(C.30)

This is a bit more efficient than a typical single-occupant car (12 km
per litre). So travelling by plane is more energy-efficient than car if
there are only one or two people in the car; and cars are more efficient
if there are three or more passengers in the vehicle.

### Key points

We've covered quite a lot of ground! Let's recap the key ideas. Half of
the work done by a plane goes into *staying up*; the other half goes
into *keeping going*. The fuel efficiency at the optimal speed,
expressed as an energy-per- distance-travelled, was found in the force
(C.22), and it was simply proportional to the weight of the plane; the
constant of proportionality is the drag-to-lift ratio, which is
determined by the shape of the plane.

![](images/figure278.png)

Figure C.10. "Fasten your cufflinks." A Bombardier Learjet 60XR carrying
8 passengers at 780 km/h has a transport cost of 150 kWh per 100
passenger-km. Photograph by Adrian Pingstone.

So whereas lowering speed-limits for cars would reduce the energy con-
sumed per distance travelled, there is no point in considering
speed-limits for planes. Planes that are up in the air have optimal
speeds, different for each plane, depending on its weight, and they
already go at their optimal speeds. If you ordered a plane to go slower,
its energy consumption would *increase*. The only way to make a plane
consume fuel more efficiently is to put it on the ground and stop it.
Planes have been fantastically optimized, and there is no prospect of
significant improvements in plane efficiency. (See pages 37 and 132 for
further discussion of the notion that new super- jumbos are "far more
efficient" than old jumbos; and p35 for discussion of the notion that
turboprops are "far more efficient" than jets.)

### Range

Another prediction we can make is, what's the range of a plane or bird –
the biggest distance it can go without refuelling? You might think that
bigger planes have a bigger range, but the prediction of our model is
startlingly simple. The range of the plane, the maximum distance it can
go before refuelling, is proportional to its velocity and to the total
energy of the fuel, and inversely proportional to the rate at which it
guzzles fuel:

![](E169-0-0.png)

(C.31)

Now, the total energy of fuel is the calorific value of the fuel, *C*
(in joules per kilogram), times its mass; and the mass of fuel is some
fraction *f*~fuel~ of the total mass of the plane. So

![](E170-0-0.png)

(C.32)

It's hard to imagine a simpler prediction: the range of any bird or
plane is the product of a dimensionless factor
*εf*~fuel~/(*c*~d~*f*~A~)^1/2^ which takes into accountthe engine
efficiency, the drag coefficient, and the bird's geometry, with a
fundamental distance,

*C*

,

*g*

which is a property of the fuel and gravity, and nothing else. No bird
size, no bird mass, no bird length, no bird width; no dependence on the
fluid density.

So what is this magic length? It's the same distance whether the fuel is
goose fat or jet fuel: both these fuels are essentially hydrocarbons
(CH~2~)~*n*~. Jet fuel has a calorific value of *C* = 40 MJ per kg. The
distance associated with jet fuel is

![](E173-0-0.png)

(C.33)

![](images/figure279.png)

Figure C.11. Boeing 737-700: 30 kWh per 100 passenger-km. Photograph ©
Tom Collins.

The range of the bird is the intrinsic range of the fuel, 4000 km, times
a factor *εf*~fuel~/(*c*~d~*f*~A~)^1/2^.If our bird has engine
efficiency *ε* = 1/3 and drag-to- lift ratio (*c*~d~*f*~A~)^1/2^ ≅ 1/20,
and if nearly half of the bird is fuel (a fully-laden 747 is 46% fuel),
we find that all birds and planes, of whatever size, have the same
range: about three times the fuel's distance – roughly 13 000 km.

This figure is again close to the true answer: the nonstop flight record
for a 747 (set on March 23–24, 1989) was a distance of 16 560 km.

And the claim that the range is independent of bird size is supported by
the observation that birds of all sizes, from great geese down to dainty
swallows and arctic tern migrate intercontinental distances. The longest
recorded non-stop flight by a bird was a distance of 11 000 km, by a
bar- tailed godwit.

How far did Steve Fossett go in the specially-designed Scaled Composites
Model 311 Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer? 41 467 km. [33ptcg] An unusual
plane: 83% of its take-off weight was fuel; the flight made careful use
of the jet-stream to boost its distance. Fragile, the plane had several
failures along the way.

One interesting point brought out by this cartoon: if we ask "what's the
optimum air-density to fly in?" , we find that the *thrust* required
(C.20) at the optimum speed is independent of the density. So our
cartoon plane would be equally happy to fly at any height; there isn't
an optimum density; the plane could achieve the same miles-per-gallon in
any density; but the optimum *speed* does depend on the density (*v*^2^
\~ 1/*ρ*, equation (C.16)). So all else being equal, our cartoon plane
would have the shortest journey time if it flew in the lowest-density
air possible. Now real engines' efficien- cies aren't independent of
speed and air density. As a plane gets lighter by burning fuel, our
cartoon says its optimal speed at a given density would reduce (*v*^2^
\~ *mg*/(*ρ*(*c*~d~*A*~p~*A*~s~)^1/2^)). So a plane travelling in air of
constant density should slow down a little as it gets lighter. But a
plane can both keep going at a *constant speed* and continue flying at
its *optimal* speed if it increases its altitude so as to reduce the air
density. Next time you're on a long-distance flight, you could check
whether the pilot increases the cruising height from, say, 31 000 feet
to 39 000 feet by the end of the flight.

### How would a hydrogen plane perform?

We've already argued that the efficiency of flight, in terms of energy
per ton-km, is just a simple dimensionless number times *g*. Changing
the fuel isn't going to change this fundamental argument.
Hydrogen-powered planes are worth discussing if we're hoping to reduce
climate-changing emissions. They might also have better range. But don't
expect them to be radically more energy-efficient.

You can think of *d*~Fuel~ as the distance that the fuel could throw
itself if it suddenly converted all its chemical energy to kinetic
energy and launched itself on a parabolic trajectory with no air
resistance. [To be precise, the distance achieved by the optimal
parabola is twice *C*/*g*.] This distance is also the *vertical* height
to which the fuel could throw itself if there were no air resistance.
Another amusing thing to notice is that the calorific value of a fuel
*C*, which I gave in joules per kilogram, is also a squared-velocity
(just as the energy-to-mass ratio *E*/*m* in Einstein's *E* = *mc*^2^ is
a squared-velocity, *c*^2^): 40 × 10^6^ J per kg is (6000 m/s)^2^. So
one way to think about fat is "fat is 6000 metres per second." If you
want to lose weight by going jogging, 6000 m/s (12 000 mph) is the speed
you should aim for in order to lose it all in one giant leap.

### Possible areas for improvement of plane efficiency

Formation flying in the style of geese could give a 10% improvement in
fuel efficiency (because the lift-to-drag ratio of the formation is
higher than that of a single aircraft), but this trick relies, of
course, on the geese wanting to migrate to the same destination at the
same time.

Optimizing the hop lengths: long-range planes (designed for a range of
say 15 000 km) are not quite as fuel-efficient as shorter-range planes,
because they have to carry extra fuel, which makes less space for cargo
and passengers. It would be more energy-efficient to fly shorter hops in
shorter-range planes. The sweet spot is when the hops are about 5000 km
long, so typical long-distance journeys would have one or two refuelling
stops (Green, 2006). Multi-stage long-distance flying might be about 15%
more fuel-efficient; but of course it would introduce other costs.

### Eco-friendly aeroplanes

Occasionally you may hear about people making eco-friendly aeroplanes.
Earlier in this chapter, however, our cartoon made the assertion that
the transport cost of *any* plane is about

0.4 kWh/ton-km.

According to the cartoon, the only ways in which a plane could signifi-
cantly improve on this figure are to reduce air resistance (perhaps by
some new-fangled vacuum-cleaners-in-the-wings trick) or to change the
geometry of the plane (making it look more like a glider, with immensely
wide wings compared to the fuselage, or getting rid of the fuselage
altogether).

So, let's look at the latest news story about "eco-friendly aviation" 
and see whether one of these planes can beat the 0.4 kWh per ton-km
bench- mark. If a plane uses less than 0.4 kWh per ton-km, we might
conclude that the cartoon is defective.

The Electra, a wood-and-fabric single-seater, flew for 48 minutes for 50
km around the southern Alps [6r32hf]. The Electra has a 9-m wingspan and
an 18-kW electric motor powered by 48 kg of lithium-polymer batteries.
The aircraft's take-off weight is 265 kg (134 kg of aircraft, 47 kg of
batteries, and 84 kg of human cargo). On 23rd December, 2007 it flew a
distance of 50 km. If we assume that the battery's energy density was
130 Wh/kg, and that the flight used 90% of a full charge (5.5 kWh), the
transport cost was roughly

0.4 kWh/ton-km,

which exactly matches our cartoon. This electrical plane is not a lower-
energy plane than a normal fossil-sucker.

Of course, this doesn't mean that electric planes are not interesting.
If one could replace traditional planes by alternatives with equal
energy

consumption but no carbon emissions, that would certainly be a useful
technology. And, as a person-transporter, the Electra delivers a
respectable 11 kWh per 100 p-km, similar to the electric car in our
transport diagram on p128. But in this book the bottom line is always:
"where is the energy to come from?"

### Many boats are birds too

Some time after writing this cartoon of flight, I realized that it
applies to more than just the birds of the air – it applies to
hydrofoils, and to other high-speed watercraft too – all those that ride
higher in the water when moving.

Figure C.13 shows the principle of the hydrofoil. The weight of the
craft is supported by a tilted underwater wing, which may be quite tiny
compared with the craft. The wing generates lift by throwing fluid down,
just like the plane of figure C.2. If we assume that the drag is
dominated by the drag on the wing, and that the wing dimensions and
vessel speed have been optimized to minimize the energy expended per
unit distance, then the best possible transport cost, in the sense of
energy per ton-kilometre, will be just the same as in equation (C.26):

![](E181-0-0.png)

(C.34)

where *c*~d~ is the drag coefficient of the underwater wing, *f*~A~ is
the dimen- sionless area ratio defined before, *ε* is the engine
efficiency, and *g* is the acceleration due to gravity.

![](images/figure500-2-0-0-0.png)

Figure C.13. Hydrofoil. Photograph by Georgios Pazios.

Perhaps *c*~d~ and *f*~A~ are not quite the same as those of an
optimized aeroplane. But the remarkable thing about this theory is that
it has no dependence on the density of the fluid through which the wing
is flying. So our ballpark prediction is that the transport cost
(energy-per-distance- per-weight, including the vehicle weight) of a
hydrofoil is *the same* as the transport cost of an aeroplane! Namely,
roughly 0.4 kWh per ton-km.

For vessels that skim the water surface, such as high-speed catamarans
and water-skiers, an accurate cartoon should also include the energy
going into making waves, but I'm tempted to guess that this hydrofoil
theory is still roughly right.

I've not yet found data on the transport-cost of a hydrofoil, but some
data for a passenger-carrying catamaran travelling at 41 km/h seem to
agree pretty well: it consumes roughly 1 kWh per ton-km.

It's quite a surprise to me to learn that an island hopper who goes from
island to island by plane not only gets there faster than someone who
hops by boat – he quite probably uses less energy too.

Other ways of staying up
------------------------

### Airships

This chapter has emphasized that planes can't be made more energy-
efficient by slowing them down, because any benefit from reduced air-
resistance is more than cancelled by having to chuck air down harder.
Can this problem be solved by switching strategy: not throwing air down,
but being as light as air instead? An airship, blimp, zeppelin, or
dirigible uses an enormous helium-filled balloon, which is lighter than
air, to counteract the weight of its little cabin. The disadvantage of
this strategy is that the enormous balloon greatly increases the air
resistance of the vehicle.

The way to keep the energy cost of an airship (per weight, per distance)
low is to move slowly, to be fish-shaped, and to be very large and long.
Let's work out a cartoon of the energy required by an idealized airship.

I'll assume the balloon is ellipsoidal, with cross-sectional area *A*
and length *L*. The volume is *V* = ^2^⁄~3~ AL. If the airship floats
stably in air of density *ρ*, the total mass of the airship, including
its cargo and its helium, must be *m*~total~ = *ρV*. If it moves at
speed *v*, the force of air resistance is

(C.35)

where *c*~d~ is the drag coefficient, which, based on aeroplanes, we
might expect to be about 0.03. The energy expended, per unit distance,
is equal to *F* divided by the efficiency *ε* of the engines. So the
gross transport cost – the energy used per unit distance per unit mass –
is

Figure C.14. The 239m-long USS Akron (ZRS-4) flying over Manhattan. It
weighed 100 t and could carry 83 t. Its engines had a total power of
3.4 MW, and it could transport 89 personnel and a stack of weapons at
93 km/h. It was also used as an aircraft carrier.

That's a rather nice result! The gross transport cost of this idealized
airship depends
only[^**E**^](http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#281) its speed
*v* and length *L*, not on the density *ρ* of the air, nor on the
airship's frontal area *A*.

This cartoon also applies without modification to submarines. The gross
transport cost (in kWh per ton-km) of an airship is just the same as the
gross transport cost of a submarine of identical length and speed. The
submarine will contain 1000 times more mass, since water is 1000 times
denser than air; and it will cost 1000 times more to move it along. The
only difference between the two will be the advertising revenue.

So, let's plug in some numbers. Let's assume we desire to travel at a
speed of 80 km/h (so that crossing the Atlantic takes three days). In SI
units, that's 22 m/s. Let's assume an efficiency *ε* of 1/4. To get the
best possible transport cost, what is the longest blimp we can imagine?
The Hindenburg was 245 m long. If we say *L* = 400 m, we find the
transport cost is:

If useful cargo made up half of the vessel's mass, the net transport
cost of this monster airship would be 0.06 kWh/t-km – similar to rail.

### Ekranoplans

The ekranoplan, or water-skimming wingship, is a ground-effect aircraft:
an aircraft that flies very close to the surface of the water, obtaining
its lift not from hurling air down like a plane, nor from hurling water
down like a hydrofoil or speed boat, but by sitting on a cushion of
compressed air sand- wiched between its wings and the nearby surface.
You can demonstrate the ground effect by flicking a piece of card across
a flat table. Maintaining this air-cushion requires very little energy,
so the ground-effect aircraft, in energy terms, is a lot like a surface
vehicle with no rolling resistance. Its main energy expenditure is
associated with air resistance. Remember that for a plane at its optimal
speed, half of its energy expenditure is associated with air resistance,
and half with throwing air down.

The Soviet Union developed the ekranoplan as a military transport ve-
hicle and missile launcher in the Khrushchev era. The Lun ekranoplan
could travel at 500 km/h, and the total thrust of its eight engines was
1000 kN, though this total was not required once the vessel had risen
clear of the water. Assuming the cruising thrust was one quarter of the
maximum; that the engines were 30% efficient; and that of its 400-ton
weight, 100 tons were cargo, this vehicle had a net freight-transport
cost of 2 kWh per ton-km. I imagine that, if perfected for non-military
freight transport, the ekranoplan might have a freight-transport cost
about half that of an ordinary aeroplane.

Mythconceptions
---------------

#### The plane was going anyway, so my flying was energy-neutral.

This is false for two reasons. First, your extra weight on the plane
requires extra energy to be consumed in keeping you up. Second, airlines
respond to demand by flying more planes.

–*Real jet engines have an efficiency of about *ε* = 1/3*. Typical
engine efficiencies are in the range 23%–36% [adg.

engine efficiency ranges between 20% and 40%, with the best bypass
engines delivering 30–37% when cruising
[www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/aviation/097. htm]. You can't simply pick the
most efficient engine however, since it may be heavier (I mean, it may
have bigger mass per unit thrust), thus reducing overall plane
efficiency.
