At sea, winds are stronger and steadier than on land, so offshore wind
farms deliver a higher power per unit area than onshore wind farms. The
Kentish Flats wind farm in the Thames Estuary, about 8.5 km offshore
from Whitstable and Herne Bay, which started operation at the end of
2005, was predicted to have an average power per unit area of 3.2
W/m^2^. In 2006, its average power per unit area was 2.6 W/m^2^.

I'll assume that a power per unit area of 3 W/m^2^ (50% larger than our
onshore estimate of 2 W/m^2^) is an appropriate figure for offshore wind
farms around the UK.

We now need an estimate of the area of sea that could plausibly be cov-
ered with wind turbines. It is conventional to distinguish between
*shallow* offshore wind and *deep* offshore wind, as illustrated in
figure 10.2. Conven- tional wisdom seems to be that *shallow* offshore
wind (depth less than 25– 30 m), while roughly twice as costly as
land-based wind, is economically feasible, given modest subsidy; and
*deep* offshore wind is at present not economically feasible. As of
2008, there's just one deep offshore windfarm in UK waters, an
experimental prototype sending all its electricity to a nearby oilrig
called Beatrice.

Shallow offshore
----------------

Within British territorial waters, the shallow area is about 40 000
km^2^, most of it off the coast of England and Wales. This area is about
two Waleses.

The average power available from shallow offshore wind farms occu- pying
the whole of this area would be 120 GW, or 48 kWh/d per person. But it's
hard to imagine this arrangement being satisfactory for shipping.
Substantial chunks of this shallow water would, I'm sure, remain
off-limits for wind farms. The requirement for shipping corridors and
fishing areas must reduce the plausibly-available area; I propose that
we assume the available fraction is one third (but please see this
chapter's end-notes for a more pessimistic view!). So we estimate the
maximum plausible power from shallow offshore wind to be 16 kWh/d per
person.

Before moving on, I want to emphasize the large area – two thirds of a
Wales – that would be required to deliver this 16 kWh/d per person. If

we take the total coastline of Britain (length: 3000 km), and put a
strip of turbines 4 km wide all the way round, that strip would have an
area of 13 000 km^2^. That is the area we must fill with turbines to
deliver 16 kWh/d per person. To put it another way, consider the number
of turbines re- quired. 16 kWh/d per person would be delivered by 44 000
"3 MW" tur- bines, which works out to 15 per kilometre of coastline, if
they were evenly spaced around 3000 km of coast.

Offshore wind is tough to pull off because of the corrosive effects of
sea water. At the big Danish wind farm, Horns Reef, all 80 turbines had
to be dismantled and repaired after only 18 months' exposure to the sea
air. The Kentish Flats turbines seem to be having similar problems with
their gearboxes, one third needing replacement during the first 18
months.

Deep offshore
-------------

The area with depths between 25 m and 50 m is about 80 000 km^2^ – the
size of Scotland. Assuming again a power per unit area of 3 W/m^2^,
"deep" off- shore wind farms could deliver another 240 GW, or 96 kWh/d
per person, if turbines completely filled this area. Again, we must make
corridors for shipping. I suggest as before that we assume we can use
one third of the area for wind farms; this area would then be about 30%
bigger than Wales,

and much of it would be further than 50 km offshore. The outcome: if an
area equal to a 9 km-wide strip all round the coast were filled with
tur- bines, deep offshore wind could deliver a power of 32 kWh/d per
person. A huge amount of power, yes; but still no match for our huge
consumption. And we haven't spoken about the issue of wind's
intermittency. We'll come back to that in Chapter 26.

I'll include this potential deep offshore contribution in the production
stack, with the proviso, as I said before, that wind experts reckon deep
offshore wind is prohibitively expensive.

Some comparisons and costs
--------------------------

So, how's our race between consumption and production coming along?
Adding both shallow and deep offshore wind to the production stack, the
green stack has a lead. Something I'd like you to notice about this
race, though, is this contrast: how *easy* it is to toss a bigger log on
the consumption fire, and how *difficult* it is to grow the production
stack. As I write this paragraph, I'm feeling a little cold, so I step
over to my thermostat and turn it up. It's so simple for me to consume
an extra 30 kWh per day. But squeezing an extra 30 kWh per day per
person from renewables requires an industrialization of the environment
so large it is hard to imagine.

To create 48 kWh per day of offshore wind per person in the UK would
require 60 million tons of concrete and steel – one ton per person.
Annual world steel production is about 1200 million tons, which is 0.2
tons per person in the world. During the second world war, American
shipyards built 2751 Liberty ships, each containing 7000 tons of steel –
that's a total of 19 million tons of steel, or 0.1 tons per American. So
the building of 60 million tons of wind turbines is not off the scale of
achievability; but don't kid yourself into thinking that it's easy.
Making this many windmills is as big a feat as building the Liberty
ships.

For comparison, to make 48 kWh per day of nuclear power per person in
the UK would require 8 million tons of steel and 0.14 million
tons[^**E**^](http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#62) of concrete.
We can also compare the 60 million tons of offshore wind hardware that
we're trying to imagine with the existing fossil-fuel hardware already
sitting in and around the North Sea (images/figure 10.4). In 1997, 200
installations and 7000 km of pipelines in the UK waters of the North Sea
contained 8 million tons of steel and concrete. The newly built Langeled
gas pipeline from Norway to Britain, which will convey gas with a power
of 25 GW (10 kWh/d/p), used another 1 million tons of steel and 1
million tons of concrete (images/figure 10.5).

The UK government announced on 10th December 2007 that it would permit
the creation of 33 GW of offshore wind capacity (which would deliver on
average 10 GW to the UK, or 4.4 kWh per day per person), a plan branded
"pie in the sky" by some in the wind industry. Let's run with a round
figure of 4 kWh per day per person. This is one quarter of my

shallow 16 kWh per day per person. To obtain this average power requires
roughly 10 000 "3 MW" wind turbines like those in figure 10.1. (They
have a capacity of "3 MW" but on average they deliver 1 MW. I pop quotes
round "3 MW" to indicate that this is a capacity, a peak power.)

What would this "33 GW"' of power cost to erect? Well, the "90 MW"
Kentish Flats farm cost £105 million, so "33 GW" would cost about £33
billion. One way to clarify this £33 billion cost of offshore wind
delivering 4 kWh/d per person is to share it among the UK population;
that comes out to £550 per person. This is a much better deal,
incidentally, than micro- turbines. A roof-mounted microturbine
currently costs about £1500 and, even at a very optimistic windspeed of
6 m/s, delivers only 1.6 kWh/d. In reality, in a typical urban location
in England, such microturbines deliver 0.2 kWh per day.

Another bottleneck constraining the planting of wind turbines is the
special ships required. To erect 10 000 wind turbines ("33 GW") over a
period of 10 years would require roughly 50 jack-up barges. These cost
£60 million each, so an extra capital investment of £3 billion would be
required. Not a show-stopper compared with the £33bn price tag already
quoted, but the need for jack-up barges is certainly a detail that
requires some forward planning.

### Costs to birds

Do windmills kill "huge numbers" of birds? Wind farms recently got ad-
verse publicity from Norway, where the wind turbines on Smola, a set of
islands off the north-west coast, killed 9 white-tailed eagles in 10
months. I share the concern of BirdLife International for the welfare of
rare birds. But I think, as always, it's important to do the numbers.
It's been esti- mated that 30 000 birds per year are killed by wind
turbines in Denmark, where windmills generate
9%[^**E**^](http://www.withouthotair.com/Errata.html#63) of the
electricity. Horror! Ban windmills! We also learn, moreover, that
*traffic* kills *one million* birds per year in Den- mark.
Thirty-times-greater horror! Thirty-times-greater incentive to ban cars!
And in Britain, 55 million birds per year are killed by *cats* (images/figure
10.6).

Going on emotions alone, I would like to live in a country with
virtually no cars, virtually no windmills, and with plenty of cats and
birds (with the cats that prey on birds perhaps being preyed upon by
Norwegian white- tailed eagles, to even things up). But what I really
hope is that decisions about cars and windmills are made by careful
rational thought, not by emotions alone. Maybe we do need the windmills!

60*The Kentish Flats wind farm in the Thames Estuary...* See
www.kentishflats.co.uk. Its 30 Vestas V90 wind turbines have a total
peak output of 90 MW, and the predicted average output was 32 MW (as-
suming a load factor of 36%). The mean wind speed at the hub height is
8.7 m/s. The turbines stand in 5 m-deep water, are spaced 700 m apart,
and occupy an area of 10 km^2^. The power density of this offshore wind
farm was thus predicted to be 3.2 W/m^2^. In fact, the average output
was 26 MW, so the average load factor in 2006 was 29% [wbd8o]. This
works out to a power den- sity of 2.6 W/m^2^. The North Hoyle wind farm
off Prestatyn, North Wales, had a higher load factor of 36% in 2006. Its
thirty 2 MW turbines occupy 8.4 km^2^. They thus had an average power
density of 2.6 W/m^2^.

It's possible that *floating* wind turbines may change the economics of
deep offshore wind.

60*The area available for offshore wind*. The Department of Trade and
Industry's (2002) document "Future Offshore" gives a detailed breakdown
of areas that are useful for offshore wind power. Table 10.7 shows the
estimated resource in 76 000 km^2^ of shallow and deep water. The DTI's
estimated power contribution, if these areas were *entirely* filled with
windmills, is 146 kWh/d per person (consisting of 52 kWh/d/p from the
shallow and 94 kWh/d/p from the deep). But the DTI's estimate of the
potential offshore wind generation resource is just 4.6 kWh per day per
person. It might be interesting to describe how they get down from this
potential resource of 146 kWh/d per person to 4.6 kWh/d per person. Why
a final figure so much lower than ours? First, they imposed these
limits: the water must be within 30 km of the shore and less than 40 m
deep; the sea bed must not have gradient greater than 5°; shipping
lanes, military zones, pipelines, fishing grounds, and wildlife reserves
are excluded. Second, they assumed that only 5% of potential sites will
be developed (as a result of seabed composition or planning
constraints); they reduced the capacity by 50% for all sites less than
10 miles from shore, for reasons of public ac- ceptability; they further
reduced the capacity of sites with wind speed over 9 m/s by 95% to
account for "development barriers presented by the hostile environment;"
and other sites with average wind speed 8–9 m/s had their capacities
reduced by 5%.

61*...if we take the total coastline of Britain (length: 3000 km), and
put a strip of turbines 4 km wide all the way round...* Pedants will say
that "the coastline of Britain is not a well-defined length, because the
coast is a fractal." Yes, yes, it's a fractal. But, dear pedant, please
take a map and put a strip of turbines 4 km wide around mainland
Britain, and see if it's not the case that your strip is indeed about
3000 km long.

63*What would "33 GW" of offshore wind cost?* According to the DTI in
Novem- ber 2002, electricity from offshore wind farms costs about £50
per MWh (5p per kWh) (Dept. of Trade and Industry, 2002b, p21). Economic
facts vary, however, and in April 2007 the estimated cost of offshore
was up to £92 per MWh (Dept. of Trade and Industry, 2007, p7). By April
2008, the price of offshore wind evidently went even higher: Shell
pulled out of their commit- ment to build the London Array. It's because
offshore wind is so expensive that the Government is having to increase
the number of ROCs (renewable obligation certificates) per unit of
offshore wind energy. The ROC is the unit of subsidy given out to
certain forms of renewable electricity generation. The standard value of
a ROC is £45, with 1 ROC per MWh; so with a wholesale price of roughly
£40/MWh, renewable generators are getting paid £85 per MWh. So 1 ROC per
MWh is not enough subsidy to cover the cost of £92 per MWh. In the same
document, estimates for other renewables (medium lev- elized costs in
2010) are as follows. Onshore wind: £65–89/MWh; co-firing of biomass:
£53/MWh; large-scale hydro: £63/MWh; sewage gas: £38/MWh; solar PV:
£571/MWh; wave: £196/MWh; tide: £177/MWh. "Dale Vince, chief executive
of green energy provider Ecotricity, which is engaged in building
onshore wind farms, said that he supported the Gov- ernment's [offshore
wind] plans, but only if they are not to the detriment of onshore wind.
‘It's dangerous to overlook the fantastic resource we have in this
country. . . By our estimates, it will cost somewhere in the region of
£40bn to build the 33 GW of offshore power Hutton is proposing. We could
do the same job onshore for £20bn'." [57984r]
